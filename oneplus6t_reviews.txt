Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.

1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product.

I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.

One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.

OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.

Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money. Go for it!

Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working

Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone

Two days back I received 6T and had many problems with the mobileThe mobile is getting heated when it's on camera mode or doing nothing., and while using mobile it's getting struck.. I don't think I got an original set, I'm sure it's a duplicate set.Please for god sake please exchange my mobile with a new one

OnePlus 6T ProsBigger display with water drop notch design look beautiful and AMOLED panel also very good.OnePlus 6T has upgraded 370mAh battery which is 400mAh bigger then OnePlus 6. It also comes with Dash charger one of the fastest smartphone chargers.The base variant comes with 6GB RAM 128GB of storage and price are same as OnePlus 6 6GB RAM 128GB storage variant.The main highlight it has the in-display fingerprint sensor and this is one of the fastest in-display fingerprint sensors.OnePlus known for their stock like Oxygen OS and this time the OnePlus 6T comes with Android 9 pie.New Camera mode like Nightscape and some other photography features are really good.OnePlus 6T ConsThe Oneplus company known to listen to their consumer’s voice, but this time There is no 3.5mm audio jack.The main cons of all OnePlus devices are lacs on microSD card support, yes it does not have any microSD card slot.There is no IP rating for waterproof and dustproof.OnePlus 6T does not have dual speakers like it should because other brands are now offering dual speaker setup.This time OnePlus also use glass at the back but it does not support wireless charging. Now, these days every flagship smartphone has wireless charging support.Frankly speaking the OnePlus 6 still a good device there is no major improvement on OnePlus 6T. If you are a OnePlus fan and wants to buy a new smartphone then you can buy this. But if you already have the OnePlus 6 then don’t waste your money because OnePlus 6 will get all the software feature via OTA updates...

They are telling it comes. With strongest back glass, on the first day itself, for a drop from 4 feet hieght my phone got a new back shattered glass

Very nice and fantastic phn, the best smart phn till date, awesome camera good battery life

Bought the costliest one. 8gb 256gb model.Received a phone with flickering screen, screen shows different colors every now and then... Battery drains fast and phone heats up even on normal usage. I have used OP3t for 2 years and never faced any problem. But This one didnt stay even for 2 days and I had to request for replacement. 1 day passed and no help, finally anazon says replacement not possible, only refund possible. I hope at least the refund process goes smooth.

mobile is very good and fast.but battery is draining like anythg..within two days of usage i found battery consumption is more than my old phone redmi note4

1. Google Play does not work properly, apps are downloading after 3-4 attempts.2. Very Heavy and does not fit well in hands3. Very poor quality of preapplied screen guard. Bubbles came only after 30 minutes of usage4. Camera is very ordinary

OnePlus you make great phones! I have bought and used every phone since OnePlus X !But it's kinda stupid to remove the headphone jack !And what did we get in return a slow fingerprint reader ?No IP rated Water resistance ? No wireless charging?Everyone's loves new features, but not at the cost of essential ones !

I like its full display and picture quality is good but temperd glass should be given to all customers

Crisp picture quality, impactful sound and an impressive battery life makes it a worthy investment. A blind buy for those who plan to upgrade to OnePlus from others...Fingerprint sensor, face unlock are exciting features but not indispensible.All in all its a fair deal if the base variant itself is 128gb!! What more can u ask for!!I'm happy...N yes...Thank you Amazon for the On time delivery..

Phone is getting hanged and face unlock is not working. I received a phone on 8th November and logged a call with amazon on 9th november that my phone is getting hanged frequently and face unlock is not working properly. They have scheduled the technician visit on 11th November, however, technician not visited. I called amazon related technician, executive told me that technician not visited due to some personal reasons. They don't bother to inform customer if technician are not going to visit.Worst experience faced ever.Don't buy anything from Amazon.I have requested for replacement,but they're denying for replacement.

Brightness is very low. I was using OnePlus 5. 20% of brightness in OnePlus 5 is equal to 65% brightness in 6T which may cause  in draining the battery. Not happy with it. Also unlocking with fingerprint is not up to the mark. Totally not so happy with it. Thinking to return it and use OnePlus 5 only

Picture quality is good. Battery life is decent. Sound quality is okay. It's not a beast in any regards considering it's price and the flagship killer tag. You may miss the notification led and the 3.5 mm audio jack. The in screen fingerprint reader is a cool feature but surely feels that first gen not so smooth feature. It just gives you the feeling of not buying a finished product but a work in progress kind of a thing. Not many things to complaint about since it does give you good specifications for a decent price but.. it's no longer a flagship killer to stay. One plus may very well be the new apple. I'd hate to see that happen, but they're in the business for profit afterall. It can't always all be about the community. But I see them get run over by budget phones if their competition could maintain quality

If yuh are a Iphone user please stay away.,Yu’ll definetely nt like it

Everything is good about the phone except some software bugs like gestures dnt work flawlessly and i have issue with paint coming out from the top part of the phone near the ear piece

I received the order @ time thanks to Amazon for delivered @ right time now coming about the phone experience as of all you know why ppl like oneplus is all because of their user interface Yea the oxygen OS it feels buttery smooth with no lag and 0 bloatware it's clean and faster than stock android.,performance is awesome no doubt on that., but display isn't upto the mark like I won't be comparing it to the Samsung displays but to their own previous generation phone., I own a oneplus 3t already been using it fa last 2 years that phone display feels more premium and vibrant than one on the oneplus 6t like 10% brightness on the oneplus 3t is equal to 40% brightness on oneplus 6t but still this display is good and another con is the headphone jack they keep trolling iPhone fa removing the headphone jack last year and used headphone jack as key marketing fa selling their phones @ US and other countries but now no headphone jack that's really ridiculous., it's okay to use the USB c to headphone connector to use while @ home but not comfortable while you do gaming or when you have your phone @ pocket during traveling like you gotta spend some 2k to 4k fa wireless., build quality is good of course it feels premium., especially the one I have Thunder purple it feels more premium., battery life is awesome it lasted about 14 hours with on screen time about 9 hours ( been playing pubg about an hour, YouTube,chatting and browsing, 4g has been on almost all these time) and yea you ll miss that led notification light and they did some compromise with built quality like the earpiece grill and sim tray looks and feels cheap material more like plastic., no stereo speakers but two sound grills and yea it kills all other phones @ performance that includes Samsung note 9 @ this price ( half the price) if you into performance go fa this phone., thermal heat management is good.

First and foremost...I really dont miss those 3.5 mm jack. Using bluetooth earpiece and the sound quality is top notch.Picture quality - initial shots taken are impressive.Battery life is best among all one plus phones.Build quality is superb. No issues with call clarity and now the best part...Oxygen OS. Its buttery smooth, fluidic and unputdownable. You will ne addicted to it.Only con is the weight of the device.

Phone is not working after update.I need immediate replacement or need my money back without further delay.

I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!

Pros: Hardware supports good speed and camera.Cons: Screen unlock doesn't work most of the time. Fingerprint is not upto mark and takes a few tries. Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one. This was the first time I had problem with a product from Amazon and they showed their true colors. Sameer goes for OnePlus.

Don't buy this Mobile worst network connectivity also no support any service centres, in Maharashtra only 4 services centre unfortunately at my location 300 km from me I was so sad call centre suggest me you visit to service centre to resolve issues .....very slow browsing like 2G phones ...... camera is good but without connecting network it's like only photographer camera...

Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is  absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered.

Battery is good. Camera is awesome. Speaker is loud and clear. Face unlock is good than expected. It would have been better if face unlock works in low light. Slow motion is awesome. Night mode is good. Could be better too. But night mode is not necessary as this phone has awesome flash... 1x zoom is good. Display is perfect. Smooth performance. No hearing issues at all.. it goes from 10 to 100 % charge in 1hour...

Great for all specs except for the battery life. Battery drains faster than expected. Without that totally worth it...

One plus 6 is better than 6t

Worst product i ordered on 1st november 2018 at 00.01 hours i got the product but only ised 1 day and now the phone is not charging and the phone is dead.Dint expect such a baaaaaaddd  product.I always used one plus but from now onwardd no one plus

The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.CONS (Ranked) -1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.PROS (Ranked) -1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.5. Great screen.6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY

I just got the new one plus 6t. But not received all other accessories with it. Only received one charger , one protective case that s it. Type C to audio adapter is missing.

Very disappointed with slow mo camera quality. I wish I could return the phone.

I just unlocked the speed today but it disappointed me I can't download apps it takes forever to download for a brand which promotes that it is very fast really disappointed.the battery also drains really fast really disappointed with the phone .I don't recommend this phone at all it also force close few apps after normal use of apps

Super nice

If you are a op5,op5t or op6 user it is not worth upgradingcons of oneplus 6t:1 the indisplay fingerprint is way too slow and does not work always2 the phone still has some network connectivity issues(s/w upgrades may fix them)3 phone works fast BUT expensive for the price and lacks good features like IR blaster,gloves mode, only limited gestures4 it seems interesting for a week, later its just a normal budget phone5 the low light photos in 'nightscape' is still bad,overall camera is just OK(not as hyped )Pros:1 Phone feels more premium than Rs.25,000 phones but still does not provide the vibe of apple or samsung(note & S series)2 has good customer care support (especially online)3  the software(oxygen OS) is really smooth,no lags at allfor those looking for phones for at least 2-3 years of usage,if possible wait for oneplus 7hope to see a triple rear camera and 5G on oneplus7

battery drain issue

I got this phone with a minor scratches on the pre installed screen protector, however I'm not sure if those are on the protector or the screen itself. I couldnt file a complain since I am travelling constantly. Will obviously reach out you guys once I'm getting back home.

1.Takes too long to charge...took 80minutes to charge from 10%-96%.2.Battery life went down from 100%to 10% in less than 20hours without much usage.3.Fingerprint sensor not very receptive.

Please don't buy..gets heated, doesn't startCustomer care has no interest pls don't buy 6t worst one plus product

Speaker is not working, not happy with the product. I have placed request for replacement but haven't received any confirmation from Amazon yet. Very disappointed.

1. Picture quality zero third class2. Heat while charging3 heat issue while playing game like pubg4. Slipry grip5. Heavy weight6. Camera in night also wrost7. When you zoom picture taken by 6t shows the blur images and red eyes8. There lack of A. I  artificial intelligence9. Face lock security is totaly unsafe i tried open with my passport size foto & opend screen lock10. Battery life is good fast charging but heating issue also11. No headfone jack you have to manage with charging jack adapter of headfoneI return after using 2 days & thanks to amazone to refund on time and saves my money by return /  refund policy

The whole product is good but 36k is more for it

It is not worth for the money. Low light camera performance still low. 25K poco does equal to 6T. In display finger print is laggy. You definitely won't like it. Good battery life.Average display. Performance is good.

I have not received headphones as promised by pre book OnePlus 6t

There are two speakers in One Plus 6T, One speaker is not working

very poor product from one plus and neither amazon is replacing the device battery didn't last long much not even 5 or 6 hours the device is malfunctioning like opening apps on it's own and volume is increasing or decreasing on it's ownnot satisfied with the product

I purchased one plus 6t on nov 1st and gor it delivered on nov 3rd. Everything is fine but touch is not functioning properly at the corners of diaplay. Didn't expect such issue with onw plus

Phone functions are nice. Battery performance is not lasting good. Battery is dying very rapidly. I am changing full charge twice in 24hrs still battery is getting down to 19%. Most funny part is that I am hardly using my phone. This is very depressing after paying such a big amount (hard earned money) of Rs. 38000/- and battery performance is so much poor.Spoken to the Amazon technical support for this. They have done some online test through some app and get to know that something is wrong with this phone battery and told me for the "BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE" on Monday 5th November 2018. I have received my phone on 2nd Nov and spoken to Amazon technical support engineer on 3rd Nov. Although I haven't received any email / SMS from Amazon yet. I can trust them on there words and will receive brand NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE on 5th November itself.

Super

Hello Guys,I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.1-  battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed  in 20k phone easily.5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.I am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good. Now choices upto you.

Overall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!

I bought one plus 6t at march 9 2019 at ₹37999.may 14 2019, i saw one plus 7 ₹37999,  with upgradable processor and camera, ONEPLUS  CHEATED WITH ME, I PAID HIGH VALUE OF ONEPLUS6T, IN FUTURE I WILL NEVER BUY ONEPLUS PRODUCT, ONEPLUS IS CHEATER,in few days drop so much price, one plus theft my money, one plus 6t is not good as youtuber say in videos, very slow fingerprint reader, camera quality is average, better life is good, all over i feel cheated by one plus, in future i never buy any oneplus product, BEWARE FRIENDS, ONEPLUS DO MARKETING THREW PAID UOUTUBERS, SO MANY GOOD BRANDS,THEY DONT DO FAKE MARKETING, AND TRUST WORTHY, LIKE, LG, SONY,AND MANY

One plus 6t is great phone but as per new price declare of oneplus 7 dat is 33k we fill cheated by oneplus and amazon .In the name of discount dey sale 6t at cost of 33k .I bought my oneplus 6t we days back for 33k and now I feel like cheated by onplus and now dey are selling better processor,better speaker and ufs 3.0 memory for 33k . Seriously oneplus should bring replacement offer for this customers

Best pH ever..👍👍👌👌

For the cost , this is one value for money product. It is feature rich and perfect for a person like me. Am an avid foodie and traveller. This is a perfect phone to capture what I want whenever I want . And with amazing clarity. Also amazing speed . I became a fan with OnePlus 3 and this one has be convinced that this is one of the best smart phone options out there.

Brought it on 3rd Nov. Attached is the list of issue- GPS turn on automatically- Bluetooth turn on Automatically- Chrome hangs very now and then- Screen Cast does not work / takes ages to connect- InScreen fingerprint scanner is worstOnline support could not solve the problem , and ask to visit service centerBeing the premium brand they have only 3 service center (???)  in city like bangalore . One visit to MG Road will cost me whole day of my time. Just thinking again was it a good choice at all ???

Airtel Sim not working on new oneplus6t, Pathetic.However other carriers are working

Battery life is better. Picture quality is good. Sound quality is also reasonably good but definitely not the best among its competitors. Having said that, this phone is really really fast. Display is awesome. Dash charger is wow as usual.

Annoyed by Amazon,i got a defective OnePlus 6t and Amazon is replacing it, and giving me excuse about seller. Its a suicide purchase for me.on screen fingerprint sensor is not working in my OnePlus 6t..and while setting fingerprint sensor it get swithed off with a loud beep sound..its kind of scary for me..pls help me guys what to do..i belong from small town..i hardly earn 20000. And i bought OnePlus 6t on a friend recommendation..i hv already sold my old phone.this is the only phone i am left with..and its a defective one..i bought it a the time of diwali when i got my salary in advance.. now my salary will come in last week of December.. i have been calling Amazon customer care from the day i purchased it and still no solutions.. feeling low..i hv given all my hard earned money buying this..dont know what to do..pls guide me.. Amazon pls help me..i m begging you.

1) Battery last only 6 to 7 hours.2) Fingerprint scanner not responding as it should.Have to reboot it then work well for some time.3) Gaming lags alot.Using at minimum graphic still lags.ONE PLUS 3T was better than this.4) Front cam gets blurred in middle of video call.5) Heating has started in new phone below back cam.Really very disappointed with Oneplus 6T was not expecting this.I have applied for a replacement but don't feel like taking a replacement.

This review is written from Oneplus 7 Pro.Bought Oneplus 6T right after the launch. It's good but the OnePlus 6 I owned was according to me better than this because there's no 3.5mm jack, fingerprint scanner is damn slow, almost rest everything is same. My friend recently bought it during summer sale for 31.5k and She was damn happy because he got a steal deal because I had bought it for 42k (8+128). Later the product turned out to be defective because she received a phone compared to mine a faulty earpiece, box almost damaged. Seems like OnePlus wants to get at least something for the defective products so they're shelling out at such big price cuts. You might be like "it's okay, I'm getting a steal deal" but if you spend a little more you'll be getting OnePlus 7 which is launched cheaper than the 6T with many upgraded specs. My advice - spend a little more and buy the 7 series or wait for the POCO F2 (Google it) similar to OnePlus 7 pro at almost half the price with same specs. Be cautious, don't get fooled. Happy shopping. :)

No headphone jack! Just bigger battery and water drop notch. No camera improvement, below expectations.... Don't buy this phone just wait for oneplus7 ( hope some exiting features)... If you have oneplus 6 then don't buy it because no major ( even minor) improvement in it ( 6 is better than 6t)  and if you are not a oneplus user then also don't buy it. I was so excited about this phone but disappointed.

As the slogan says never settle....proper flagship killer

I got this phone on Friday evening.Pros:Great battery lifeAmazing performancePremium designImpressive rear and front cameraIn display fingerprint scanner is really fastCons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converterNo notification LEDNo microSD card slotI will give points on my personal experience of 2 days full usage as below:Weight: 9/10OS: 10/10Screen size: 10/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (you'll get approx 113 gb for use)Battery: 8/10Rear camera: 10/10Front camera: 10/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 10/10I hope this will help full.

Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems.

1. The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.2. Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.3. Camera quality is very poor.4. Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.5. While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.6. Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product.

I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.

One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.

OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.

Good build.amazing battery life. ( Minimum 3 days stand by along with basic use in airtel's 4g network)good accessories on op site.cool phone box packing.in display fingerprint sensor & face recognition both are good.loudspeaker is decent. has a c type to 3.5mm adapter in the box.value for money. Go for it!

Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working

Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone

Two days back I received 6T and had many problems with the mobileThe mobile is getting heated when it's on camera mode or doing nothing., and while using mobile it's getting struck.. I don't think I got an original set, I'm sure it's a duplicate set.Please for god sake please exchange my mobile with a new one

This has by far been the best phone I have ever used hands-on. Flagship Specs, Classy look, Premium Packaging and the Speed you Need!Appearance - The device looks very much similar to the OnePlus 6T upfront but it has got the speed orange highlights at the back, carbon finish and McLaren Branding at the bottom.Camera - The night mode really captures amazing pictures and the portrait mode is just amazing. The low light photography could still be improved.Battery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.Speed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag. And its bragging rights for sure!Overall, I am really satisfied with this device and feels great to be a part of OnePlus Community! Go, get it! Its for those, who are in continuous pursuit for speed!

Battery-Extremely PoorCamera-SatisfactoryLook-GoodWeight-GoodSound-SuperbOverall I would have given it half star,deeply through by it's battery.And even after the replacement,the same problem persists,which means it's a clear cut case of faulty manufacturing.Please don't buy it,if you really love your hard earned money.....

After replace the handset issue was resolved. Now i unlocked the speed i need.

Got delivered in just 2.5 hours of my order. No bad overservations yet. Fingerprint unlock is also good, if you have face unlock ON then all the time it will unlock with face data before the the fingerprint works.

The device is very bad. Camera quality is very poor. Please don't buy it guys go for Apple iPhone XS instead. Apple has a far better Camera.No Color options in 256gb variant. OnePlus should learn from Apple they have a lot of Color options at the time of launch. OnePlus is not worth the price.

Amazing phone, just feels good.Done the ma+h, price isn't everything.You get what you pay for. :)Excellent battery,Great screen,Amazing performance,Smoooth OS,Great camera,Surprisingly decent audio,Cool screen unlock and ridiculously fast face unlock.The phone is worth every penny spent.

Camera pics are not having good quality. Pixel is not clear

The in-display fingerprint sensor is very bad. It is slow and many times it takes multiple attempts to scan the finger. This phone is big disappointment. I would not recommend this phone at all.They didn't give headphone jack which is okay as they were giving free bullets V2 for those who pre-booked the phone. But they should atleast have given IP rating as IP gives peace of mind and stereo speaker should have been there instead of dummy holes at bottom. Needless to say that Oneplus phones have good software and this one is no exception. This has good software which is fast and fluid. My point is that don't buy this phone for fingerprint sensor. If you are having other OnePlus phone then you should hold for next OnePlus phone.

Used it for close to 45 days now, overall a very good phone but for this price point i would expect much better camera. Since Asus Zenfone 5Z also gives similar performance at almost less than 10K. Camera in night mode needs more improvement and does not capture the picture properly .. may be i need to do some tweeks in settings i am not sure. Please see the image i uploaded the fire is tarnished with grey .. same picture without night mode is much better. This is my first 1+ phone .. satisfied but because of camera giving 4 stars.

Issue with the Camera Slow Motion Mode is Not Working in Home Black Shade is Moving from left to right Sound Quality is not that good

Brightness is very low. I was using OnePlus 5. 20% of brightness in OnePlus 5 is equal to 65% brightness in 6T which may cause  in draining the battery. Not happy with it. Also unlocking with fingerprint is not up to the mark. Totally not so happy with it. Thinking to return it and use OnePlus 5 only

Picture quality is good. Battery life is decent. Sound quality is okay. It's not a beast in any regards considering it's price and the flagship killer tag. You may miss the notification led and the 3.5 mm audio jack. The in screen fingerprint reader is a cool feature but surely feels that first gen not so smooth feature. It just gives you the feeling of not buying a finished product but a work in progress kind of a thing. Not many things to complaint about since it does give you good specifications for a decent price but.. it's no longer a flagship killer to stay. One plus may very well be the new apple. I'd hate to see that happen, but they're in the business for profit afterall. It can't always all be about the community. But I see them get run over by budget phones if their competition could maintain quality

If yuh are a Iphone user please stay away.,Yu’ll definetely nt like it

Everything is good about the phone except some software bugs like gestures dnt work flawlessly and i have issue with paint coming out from the top part of the phone near the ear piece

I received the order @ time thanks to Amazon for delivered @ right time now coming about the phone experience as of all you know why ppl like oneplus is all because of their user interface Yea the oxygen OS it feels buttery smooth with no lag and 0 bloatware it's clean and faster than stock android.,performance is awesome no doubt on that., but display isn't upto the mark like I won't be comparing it to the Samsung displays but to their own previous generation phone., I own a oneplus 3t already been using it fa last 2 years that phone display feels more premium and vibrant than one on the oneplus 6t like 10% brightness on the oneplus 3t is equal to 40% brightness on oneplus 6t but still this display is good and another con is the headphone jack they keep trolling iPhone fa removing the headphone jack last year and used headphone jack as key marketing fa selling their phones @ US and other countries but now no headphone jack that's really ridiculous., it's okay to use the USB c to headphone connector to use while @ home but not comfortable while you do gaming or when you have your phone @ pocket during traveling like you gotta spend some 2k to 4k fa wireless., build quality is good of course it feels premium., especially the one I have Thunder purple it feels more premium., battery life is awesome it lasted about 14 hours with on screen time about 9 hours ( been playing pubg about an hour, YouTube,chatting and browsing, 4g has been on almost all these time) and yea you ll miss that led notification light and they did some compromise with built quality like the earpiece grill and sim tray looks and feels cheap material more like plastic., no stereo speakers but two sound grills and yea it kills all other phones @ performance that includes Samsung note 9 @ this price ( half the price) if you into performance go fa this phone., thermal heat management is good.

First and foremost...I really dont miss those 3.5 mm jack. Using bluetooth earpiece and the sound quality is top notch.Picture quality - initial shots taken are impressive.Battery life is best among all one plus phones.Build quality is superb. No issues with call clarity and now the best part...Oxygen OS. Its buttery smooth, fluidic and unputdownable. You will ne addicted to it.Only con is the weight of the device.

Phone is not working after update.I need immediate replacement or need my money back without further delay.

I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!

Pros: Hardware supports good speed and camera.Cons: Screen unlock doesn't work most of the time. Fingerprint is not upto mark and takes a few tries. Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one. This was the first time I had problem with a product from Amazon and they showed their true colors. Sameer goes for OnePlus.

Don't buy this Mobile worst network connectivity also no support any service centres, in Maharashtra only 4 services centre unfortunately at my location 300 km from me I was so sad call centre suggest me you visit to service centre to resolve issues .....very slow browsing like 2G phones ...... camera is good but without connecting network it's like only photographer camera...

Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is  absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered.

Battery is good. Camera is awesome. Speaker is loud and clear. Face unlock is good than expected. It would have been better if face unlock works in low light. Slow motion is awesome. Night mode is good. Could be better too. But night mode is not necessary as this phone has awesome flash... 1x zoom is good. Display is perfect. Smooth performance. No hearing issues at all.. it goes from 10 to 100 % charge in 1hour...

Great for all specs except for the battery life. Battery drains faster than expected. Without that totally worth it...

One plus 6 is better than 6t

Worst product i ordered on 1st november 2018 at 00.01 hours i got the product but only ised 1 day and now the phone is not charging and the phone is dead.Dint expect such a baaaaaaddd  product.I always used one plus but from now onwardd no one plus

The most COMPLETE and HONEST review :-This phone is OUTSTANDING! Mostly in a really good sense, ALTHOUGH somewhere we HAVE TO SETTLE.CONS (Ranked) -1. NO STEREO SPEAKERS , although single mono speaker is good.2. HEADPHONE AUDIO OUTPUT (c type / 3.5 mm / whatever) is ABOVE AVERAGE, but should have been better with greater bass and more fuller ambient sound like LG G7 ThinQ etc. I'll update my review about the Cirrus Logic DAC and Oneplus C type Bullets later.3. Camera depends upon good lighting conditions. TOO MUCH CROP IN FRONT CAMERA VIDEO DUE TO EIS. BLUR IN NIGHTSCAPE, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S MOVEMENT IN FRAME. Wide angle camera should have been a must.4. Fingerprint scanner is like 90% hit and 10% miss. For 97% hit and 3% miss, INPUT SAME FINGER TWICE OR THRICE. PROPER PLACEMENT OF FINGER ON SCANNER is IMPORTANT. However it's SUFFICIENTLY FAST. Placement should have been upper on the screen.5. NO NOTIFICATION LED. SCREEN OFF GESTURES (like O for camera) are HITS AND MISSES OCCASIONALLY.P. S. NO HEADPHONE JACK, NO QHD RESOLUTION and NO WIRELESS CHARGING are NOT CONS, atleast for me.PROS (Ranked) -1. The very BEST SOFTWARE, UI, PERFORMANCE. (CLEAN, FAST AND SMOOTH). MANY CUSTOMISATIONS. BETTER THAN STOCK ANDROID.2. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY and DESIGN like in display fingerprint scanner, cute waterdrop notch etc.3. PREMIUM AND DURABLE BUILD QUALITY. UNOFFICIALLY WATERPROOF.4. GREAT BATTERY life AND DASH CHARGING.5. Great screen.6. Camera can compete with PIXEL 3.7. GREAT VALUE for the price. However, COULD BE of GREATER VALUE. COMPETITION - LG G7 ThinQ, Asus Zenfone 5Z, iPhone 6S plus, etc.P. S. You'll read many PROS in official reviews in the internet, YouTube etc..All in all, the phone and the brand DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION.4.5 OUT OF 5 - ABHISHEK CHAKRAVORTY

I just got the new one plus 6t. But not received all other accessories with it. Only received one charger , one protective case that s it. Type C to audio adapter is missing.

Very disappointed with slow mo camera quality. I wish I could return the phone.

I just unlocked the speed today but it disappointed me I can't download apps it takes forever to download for a brand which promotes that it is very fast really disappointed.the battery also drains really fast really disappointed with the phone .I don't recommend this phone at all it also force close few apps after normal use of apps

Super nice

If you are a op5,op5t or op6 user it is not worth upgradingcons of oneplus 6t:1 the indisplay fingerprint is way too slow and does not work always2 the phone still has some network connectivity issues(s/w upgrades may fix them)3 phone works fast BUT expensive for the price and lacks good features like IR blaster,gloves mode, only limited gestures4 it seems interesting for a week, later its just a normal budget phone5 the low light photos in 'nightscape' is still bad,overall camera is just OK(not as hyped )Pros:1 Phone feels more premium than Rs.25,000 phones but still does not provide the vibe of apple or samsung(note & S series)2 has good customer care support (especially online)3  the software(oxygen OS) is really smooth,no lags at allfor those looking for phones for at least 2-3 years of usage,if possible wait for oneplus 7hope to see a triple rear camera and 5G on oneplus7

battery drain issue

I got this phone with a minor scratches on the pre installed screen protector, however I'm not sure if those are on the protector or the screen itself. I couldnt file a complain since I am travelling constantly. Will obviously reach out you guys once I'm getting back home.

1.Takes too long to charge...took 80minutes to charge from 10%-96%.2.Battery life went down from 100%to 10% in less than 20hours without much usage.3.Fingerprint sensor not very receptive.

Please don't buy..gets heated, doesn't startCustomer care has no interest pls don't buy 6t worst one plus product

Speaker is not working, not happy with the product. I have placed request for replacement but haven't received any confirmation from Amazon yet. Very disappointed.

1. Picture quality zero third class2. Heat while charging3 heat issue while playing game like pubg4. Slipry grip5. Heavy weight6. Camera in night also wrost7. When you zoom picture taken by 6t shows the blur images and red eyes8. There lack of A. I  artificial intelligence9. Face lock security is totaly unsafe i tried open with my passport size foto & opend screen lock10. Battery life is good fast charging but heating issue also11. No headfone jack you have to manage with charging jack adapter of headfoneI return after using 2 days & thanks to amazone to refund on time and saves my money by return /  refund policy

The whole product is good but 36k is more for it

It is not worth for the money. Low light camera performance still low. 25K poco does equal to 6T. In display finger print is laggy. You definitely won't like it. Good battery life.Average display. Performance is good.

I have not received headphones as promised by pre book OnePlus 6t

Just got mine last week for 33k. And now they are launching one plus 7 for 33k which has d latest processor, better screen, speaker and finger print sensor. Amazon has been really unfair by selling 6t at 33k. Please don't go for 6t. They just want to clear the stocks. Wait for a while you will get this more a more cheaper price. Highly dissappointed

The phone got stuck while using one of camera features. Its not even getting restarted. The screen is freezed thus, not allowing to proceed further. Hope i get a replacement soon.

Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor. It is very sensible I must say unlike the back one. I need to put my finger in proper way otherwise I won't be able to unlock my phone.

Damaged

I am a big fan of Apple. Have been using Iphone from last 5 years. Wanted to change the phone to the new one. But not much of Innovation from Apple. So, I switched to Oneplus and Oneplus 6T was a best replacement.The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.Design: Just gorgeous - the curve of the camera bump is more of a design accent than a notch. The phone has a huge 6.41 in screen, but is still easily managed with one hand. The color is amazing - Mirror Black. The 6T feels like it was meant to fit in my hand. The first party OnePlus cases accent the amazing design and make it even more comfortable. When you hold the phone, you will know exactly what I mean!Battery: Lasts more than a day with heavy use. I can get almost 6 hrs of screen on time even after watching YouTube, gaming, and general usage. Even better, the included dash charger fills the battery extremely quickly. No wireless charging, but I don't even miss it.Camera: Solid - 4K 60FPS video looks great. Other phones in this price range can't even touch the quality of the camera for pictures. Night shot is solid, looking forward to Future tweeks to prevent the blown out appearance when some light is present.Sound: Probably the only change I would make. The since downward firing speaker is easy to block. The quality is great - would love to see the dual speaker in the next OnePlus phone.While you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing the OnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger, thicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery with better longevity is it really a loss?The headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with an adapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the same footprint otherwise.

Best phone !!!In love with the fingerprint scanner and it's animation !Battery lasts one day !Industry leading camera with studio mode works fantastic !Catchy display !Fast like a flash !Great Value for money !!!!!

Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone.

Received faulty piece of mobile, battery can't even last for 6 hours, I am going to return it

They are exactly Working on their tag line "the speed you need". It's very fast. Very very fast. Talking about camera, that would have been better than op6. But nothing changed. Night scape is very good change. You can feel the light in nightscape mode. Audio is better than most of smartphones but not up to One plus mark. Battery life is best. You can rely on his battery for only one charge of half an hour with full day battery life even if you use it fully. Fingerprint scanner can't be better. New update help him open fast. If you have budget of 35k, buy it without second thought.

DESIGN:If you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.Visible differences between 6 & 6T:Higher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.Technical advancement:Advance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.CAMERA:I took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.BATTERY:Battery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !SPEAKERS:External speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.SECURITY:Though I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes.

There are two speakers in One Plus 6T, One speaker is not working

very poor product from one plus and neither amazon is replacing the device battery didn't last long much not even 5 or 6 hours the device is malfunctioning like opening apps on it's own and volume is increasing or decreasing on it's ownnot satisfied with the product

I purchased one plus 6t on nov 1st and gor it delivered on nov 3rd. Everything is fine but touch is not functioning properly at the corners of diaplay. Didn't expect such issue with onw plus

Phone functions are nice. Battery performance is not lasting good. Battery is dying very rapidly. I am changing full charge twice in 24hrs still battery is getting down to 19%. Most funny part is that I am hardly using my phone. This is very depressing after paying such a big amount (hard earned money) of Rs. 38000/- and battery performance is so much poor.Spoken to the Amazon technical support for this. They have done some online test through some app and get to know that something is wrong with this phone battery and told me for the "BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE" on Monday 5th November 2018. I have received my phone on 2nd Nov and spoken to Amazon technical support engineer on 3rd Nov. Although I haven't received any email / SMS from Amazon yet. I can trust them on there words and will receive brand NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE on 5th November itself.

Super

Hello Guys,I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.1-  battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed  in 20k phone easily.5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.I am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good. Now choices upto you.

Overall: 8/10:A fantastic package at good value. 6T McLaren is'nt much different from the standard 6T except for the RAM and some minor cosmetic changes. But for a long time fan of the Silver Arrows from Mika Hakkinen's time, a small increase in price was worth it. Call me sentimental! :)Unboxing & contents: 8/10One of the coolest unboxing experiences. The McLaren box is very premium and the booklet starts with giving you a brief glimpse into the history of the brand and some cool pictures from the archives. It is an homage to Bruce McLaren to be honest. The Speed Mark (real Carbon Fire cutout of the McLaren logo) encased in acrylic is pretty good and can serve as a cool table top accessory or paper weight. If not for much it can be a good ice breaker for visitors to your home / office. The Charger and Cable are also customized for the McLaren edition. The Soft PU case is simple black and fits snugly. There was a missed opportunity to throw in some colour for the McLaren edition. All else is pretty much standard. Providing only a USB-C to 3.5 converter is a bummer. For the flagship offering at over 50K, throwing in a Bullet Earphone should have been standard.First Impressions: 9/10The device is actually pretty impressive looking. Especially the orange accents at the Bezel on the back. When you change the angle under light, it almost looks like there are LEDs inside. It looks premium for sure though an actual Carbon Fibre body would have been awesome! Be warned though that the surface is a fingerprint magnet and not easy to wipe off unless you use a good cleaning spray. The Waterdrop notch is barely noticeable and is not much of an issue. The colours are vibrant and while setting up you can choose a profile that suits your taste.Setup: 8/10The SIM Card tray is a standard two Nano-SIM one. No SD Card support still! But with 240 GB usable memory, not much of an issue to be honest. I used the OnePlus switch app to transfer my apps, data and settings. The transition was hassle free and took all of 15 minutes. Most apps worked immediately but a few needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled as they were acting up. I gave it a point less as I think the OnePlus Switch app should be integrated at the setup stage instead of making a new user download it. The phone heats up considerably but it was fine after the initial 30 minutes.Battery: 7/10The unit came with 50% power out of the box and it took me a good 30 minutes to get it to 75% despite using the Warp Charge @ 30W. Probably it was due to the fact that close to 100 apps were being downloaded while it was charging. I will check the charging performance over the next few weeks and update review if required.Performance: 9/10Gaming: Initial performance on gaming is very very good (Asphalt 9 Legends and Real Racing 3). Zero lag and super smooth rendering.  Bloons TD6 is a very resource hungry at lategame levels and the 6T McLaren  made short work of it.Display: The display is really mind-blowing. Video on Youtube and other streaming apps was super smooth and brilliant to look at. One cool feature is that you can pinch zoom the content to include / exclude the waterdrop notch for front camera.  Adaptive brightness is annoying at times and I had to turn it off while playing the racing games.Camera: Have not tested the Camera performance yet. Especially the 4K 60 FPS option. Will do it soon and update the review.Hope this helps!

I bought one plus 6t at march 9 2019 at ₹37999.may 14 2019, i saw one plus 7 ₹37999,  with upgradable processor and camera, ONEPLUS  CHEATED WITH ME, I PAID HIGH VALUE OF ONEPLUS6T, IN FUTURE I WILL NEVER BUY ONEPLUS PRODUCT, ONEPLUS IS CHEATER,in few days drop so much price, one plus theft my money, one plus 6t is not good as youtuber say in videos, very slow fingerprint reader, camera quality is average, better life is good, all over i feel cheated by one plus, in future i never buy any oneplus product, BEWARE FRIENDS, ONEPLUS DO MARKETING THREW PAID UOUTUBERS, SO MANY GOOD BRANDS,THEY DONT DO FAKE MARKETING, AND TRUST WORTHY, LIKE, LG, SONY,AND MANY

One plus 6t is great phone but as per new price declare of oneplus 7 dat is 33k we fill cheated by oneplus and amazon .In the name of discount dey sale 6t at cost of 33k .I bought my oneplus 6t we days back for 33k and now I feel like cheated by onplus and now dey are selling better processor,better speaker and ufs 3.0 memory for 33k . Seriously oneplus should bring replacement offer for this customers

Best pH ever..👍👍👌👌

Phone is good and phone sound was very good but battery is very bad  I am not satisfied this phone

I got a defective product

Very baf

I have used two days and phone is good with speed and multi tasking but camera is worst, it did not meet even a normal 10000 rupees phone camera feature. I am planning to sell it out in OLX. Oneplus should stop increasing the phone size, since phone is slippery in the hand with 6.41 inches, always 6 or less than 6 inches phones are good to carry and handy.

Things are not the same as promoted, I bought this on 2nd Nov, look wise its good, sound is also loud, its just loud nothin else, battery has just improved marginally if you keep your location on and play some game or video, it will be low very soon. Ofcourse at the end it will hang little longer but not as expected. Display Hangs!! Yes!!! this phone hangs even with 8gb RAM, have faced it few times even in first 10 days. Worst part is the front screen lock is too too slow, even i have to use pin code most of the time. Overall the phone launch was just a hype but the performance is not upto the expectation!!!

Purchased with great excitement but disappointed the day i got this phone.. Being a flagship killer, i never expected this phone to face heat issues even with a normal usage..the same problem didn't arise with my brother's phone which he took on the same day... Apps didn't download but some how solved that issue later.. And now some apps are force closing and not working.. Remaining features live upto the mark. But being a oneplus fan, my expectations were sky-high about the 6t..slightly disappointed but not a big deal.. Can adjust with this.

Adding another call, when a call is already in progress is night mare. Either app crashes or it doesnt allow. During phone call disabling blue tooth is not posisble. I see lot of UI issues. God only why people were so hyped about this phone. its not doing what 7000rs Samsung phone does. Please don't buy this phone and waste your money.

I bought this phone for Rs 31499 after SBI discount and company after 3 days announced OnePlus 7 that too cheaper than its predecessor. When OnePlus sees that it cannot compete with fellow manufacturers it started decreasing its price and standard. Seriously, this manufacturer won't last long.

Here is my review of op6 McLaren Edn after 4 days of uses.Camera is excellent, takes outstanding pictures. Sound quality is ok but not at par. Oneplus could have done better.Battery life is phenomenal. Lasts for almost 30 hours with 10 hours of screen on time. Running 4g all the time.The one and only con that I observed is internet speed is very slow . I saw someone's review before buying this phone that network strength is very good compared to other phones and indeed it is. But inspite of having good signals, the 4g internet speed is very slow. And I mean very slow like 2g. McLaren doesn't stand up to its name. Did all the tricks, read all the forums about the solution but nothing worked. Same sim is giving excellent speed in another phone.I feel like cheated. Whats the point keeping superfast phone if you cannot have a fast internet.Won't recommend anyone to buy this phone.

Best Android phone till date. I have been using it for 3 days now and OnePlus didn't let me down.* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.This is the best phone you can buy in 2018 and early 2019 at around 35-40k. So go ahead and buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it!

For the cost , this is one value for money product. It is feature rich and perfect for a person like me. Am an avid foodie and traveller. This is a perfect phone to capture what I want whenever I want . And with amazing clarity. Also amazing speed . I became a fan with OnePlus 3 and this one has be convinced that this is one of the best smart phone options out there.

Brought it on 3rd Nov. Attached is the list of issue- GPS turn on automatically- Bluetooth turn on Automatically- Chrome hangs very now and then- Screen Cast does not work / takes ages to connect- InScreen fingerprint scanner is worstOnline support could not solve the problem , and ask to visit service centerBeing the premium brand they have only 3 service center (???)  in city like bangalore . One visit to MG Road will cost me whole day of my time. Just thinking again was it a good choice at all ???

Airtel Sim not working on new oneplus6t, Pathetic.However other carriers are working

Battery life is better. Picture quality is good. Sound quality is also reasonably good but definitely not the best among its competitors. Having said that, this phone is really really fast. Display is awesome. Dash charger is wow as usual.

Annoyed by Amazon,i got a defective OnePlus 6t and Amazon is replacing it, and giving me excuse about seller. Its a suicide purchase for me.on screen fingerprint sensor is not working in my OnePlus 6t..and while setting fingerprint sensor it get swithed off with a loud beep sound..its kind of scary for me..pls help me guys what to do..i belong from small town..i hardly earn 20000. And i bought OnePlus 6t on a friend recommendation..i hv already sold my old phone.this is the only phone i am left with..and its a defective one..i bought it a the time of diwali when i got my salary in advance.. now my salary will come in last week of December.. i have been calling Amazon customer care from the day i purchased it and still no solutions.. feeling low..i hv given all my hard earned money buying this..dont know what to do..pls guide me.. Amazon pls help me..i m begging you.

1) Battery last only 6 to 7 hours.2) Fingerprint scanner not responding as it should.Have to reboot it then work well for some time.3) Gaming lags alot.Using at minimum graphic still lags.ONE PLUS 3T was better than this.4) Front cam gets blurred in middle of video call.5) Heating has started in new phone below back cam.Really very disappointed with Oneplus 6T was not expecting this.I have applied for a replacement but don't feel like taking a replacement.

This review is written from Oneplus 7 Pro.Bought Oneplus 6T right after the launch. It's good but the OnePlus 6 I owned was according to me better than this because there's no 3.5mm jack, fingerprint scanner is damn slow, almost rest everything is same. My friend recently bought it during summer sale for 31.5k and She was damn happy because he got a steal deal because I had bought it for 42k (8+128). Later the product turned out to be defective because she received a phone compared to mine a faulty earpiece, box almost damaged. Seems like OnePlus wants to get at least something for the defective products so they're shelling out at such big price cuts. You might be like "it's okay, I'm getting a steal deal" but if you spend a little more you'll be getting OnePlus 7 which is launched cheaper than the 6T with many upgraded specs. My advice - spend a little more and buy the 7 series or wait for the POCO F2 (Google it) similar to OnePlus 7 pro at almost half the price with same specs. Be cautious, don't get fooled. Happy shopping. :)

No headphone jack! Just bigger battery and water drop notch. No camera improvement, below expectations.... Don't buy this phone just wait for oneplus7 ( hope some exiting features)... If you have oneplus 6 then don't buy it because no major ( even minor) improvement in it ( 6 is better than 6t)  and if you are not a oneplus user then also don't buy it. I was so excited about this phone but disappointed.

pros:-1.gorilla glass 62.battery3700mah,3.fast face unlock,4.overall good quality camera,5.no bloatware like samsung or mi phones,6.fast performance with 6/8 gb ram ,and 845 processor,7.128/256 gb storage,8.optic amoled display,9.both side glass with aluminium frame (with a free case),10.fast fingerprint unlock(fixed with a software update),11.fast charging with dash charger,12.monthly security patch,and few major android update will expected to arrive in next few years,which is a big credit for oneplus.13.no overheating issue,cons:-1.battery drains fast,2.no 3.5mm jack,3.no stereo speaker4.portrait mode photos are always not so good.

As the slogan says never settle....proper flagship killer

Picture quality worst

The discount could have been more

1. If you will see IPHONE then each application's UI will be the semetrical and properly handled, Unlike the oneplus 6T  if you will notice then while you are in CHAT then Bottom SEND and left SMILY button will not show 100% properly.2. Without using any app it consumes 4+GB of RAM.3. Camera quality is OK+ , Because its using almost same library of PIXEL phone, But not match that image processing quality. FRONT CAMERA QUALITY is just WROST ever if you will try on Artificial Light condition.4. If you ZOOM once you took the picture it will not show the Best quality resolution.4. If your phone will be in IDEAL mode for 10+ mins then your phone will be freeze for 7-8 Seconds.

Worst service from amazon.never expected this.lost believe in this.they delivered defective piece and not providing the replacement for this.Horrible ecperience

I like this product very much

The product was defective. And amazon kept me on wait for 10 days for no reason to replace the phone,even it was manufacturing defects.

I am experiencing very difficulty in receiving calls and I'm conversation with my callers THROUGH AIRTEL since it is being used for official purpose. In the 2nd slot BSNL sim. Although it is working but sometimes it also giving similar problem. Sound quality is poor, using full volume is require to hear the caller voice. I tried my best to exchange the device within the return period but failed as I experienced very difficulty in replacing the product with AMAZON THIS TIME.MY PRESENT STATUS IS THAT SOME HOW I HAVE TO DISPOSED IT.I FIND MORE BETTER WITH MY REDMI NOTE 5 PRO.I am just waiting for 15-20 days as ONE PLUS CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTRE INFOM ME THAT IT WILL BE QUITE ALRIGHT AFTER AN UPGRADATION WICH IS ABOT TO COME WITHIN THE ABOVE TIME.However, I can only say that being a prime member I maintained a higher expectations but disappointed. SORRY.

The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.Cons :Concern is the notification led light. we are not sure whether battery is 100% while charging. Single touch display to see notification is beautiful.One plus should have added the charge + 3.5 jack in type c converter. which would be added value for those who watch movie or listen song while charging.

Best phone i ever had

Battery is terribly bad.On round edges I lose the display as it cuts the actual view.Sometimes AutoRotate does not work. I have to restart the mobile.

Just superb

This is my first OnePlus Device and it feels amazing that how fast this phone is! I switched from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I'm glad I did....Battery life is just outstanding and I've never ever got such a powerful battery ever in my smartphone life. It actually lasts more than a day with lots of playing (I'm a Gamer) and general usage. Camera is also very good and certainly better than my previous phone. UI is clean and lightning fast. Build quality and finish is premium, sturdy and not at all fragile. The in-box Type-C to 3.5mm Adapter solves the absence of headphone jack problem. The supplied case is of premium quality and easily gives all-round protection to any angle falls. Dash charging is superb too. Android Pie out-of-the-box is cool but restricts call recording from third party apps (which is must for me), but OP did a fantastic job of putting in-built call recorder which works flawlessly in Pie as well. As of now, I don't see a single negative point for this phone. Its truly a remarkable one! Thank You OnePlus and Amazon!

Lovely mobile... Simply love it.

The camera is awesome, performance and battery backup are also very good.But I am sad, I bought in 42 thousand just two months before and now Amazon is selling it in 32 thousand. I am just feeling cheated.

I have been blown away by the performance of this phone.. Everything is smooth and easy. So lets talk about pros and cons:Pros:1. Screen quality is great and due to the rain drop notch the real estate has increased drastically.2. Battery life is the best. You charge it once and even after full day use, its around 30 percent. No need to carry a charger now.3. With Android pie the apps run smoothly without a hitch and after a month of purchase, its already been updated thrice.4. Wifi connectivity has increased as compared to earlier models.5. Due to its aspect ratio, the phone is easy to use by one hand.Cons:1. Camera is good but not too great as the features are basic. One plus needs to work on its camera app and give more features to use double lenses effectively. The video has stability issues.2. The sound quality is better than earleir models but still needs to be louder.3. The screen protector is a smudge magnet and i would suggest a better screen protector.4. The sunlight visibility is not too great.Still after considering all these factors the phone is great and people tend to notice it in your hand.My verdict:Worth buying. Go for it. You will surely be excited.

The alert slider is not working. Did not expect a defected piece from amazon. very disappointing. for replacement a technicuan from amazon will come and report. before that im left wid no phone. its so disheartening.

Phone is awesome camera check display check battery check... There is minor glitch with play store it is pathetic to download a new app as they always shows downloading or download pending.... Hope OnePlus will fix this...

The phone is excellent software and internals wise. However the cons are as follows:- all glass. Serves no purpose and makes the phone fragile- no notification light- no headphone jack. Pointless omission simply to ape Apple- ambient display brightens up too much for sensing fingerprint and is very irritating at night- phone is a tad too big. They should ideally have kept the 5.5 screen size from the op5 days and removed the bezels instead of increasing the size of the phone- terrible vibration motor. My old nokias from the last decade had much better vibration. Not expected from such a premium phone

I bought 2 phones (one in Nov. 2018 and the 2nd one on Jan. 2019) from Amazon.  The new Oneplus Avtar will certainly satisfy those users who can compromise with the loss of headphone jack and  notification led. The usb C- headphone jack adapter is in noway an alternative. Similarly, people will expect a stereo speaker on a phone of this price range -- even Poco F1 and Asus Zenfone 5Z provide it at a much lower cost. Yes, 6t offers a lot of excellent features: its superb display, flagship hardware, software, excellent performance, great camera and, to some extent, good battery life, but the loss of some useful feature will deter many potential buyers accustomed with headphones and notification light. Here are some pros and cons of OP6t:Pros:1. A flagship with excellent looks and built quality.2. Great optic AMOLED display with superb viewing angle.3. Flagship Snapdragon 845 processor with 6GB RAM (with excellent RAM Management) makes it one of the fastest (if not the fastest) phone available in India.4. Latest android with butter smooth OS5. Great cameras, which become superb after recent updates. Back Camera takes excellent photos some of which are  even better than those takes with Google Pixel, iphone and to some extent Samsung Note 9.6. Specific Pixel 3 camera mod has now been made available for OP6t and tested it on my phone. Results are easily comparable.7. Great battery life; for my case with moderate use it lasts more than 2 days. Charging from 0 to 100% takes less than 1.5 hrs.8. Fast face unlocking capability.9. Very good call quality and connectivity.Cons:1. No headphone jack and notification LED.2. Fingerprint sensor is slower than that in OP6 although authentication process is accurate.3. Sound quality is good but does not match with the stereo speakers of the cheaper Asus Zenfone 5z or even Poco Fi.4. Only a single base version colour option (mirror black) both front and back sides of which are fingerprint magnets.

This was for my sister. She previously had iphone 8 and believe me she loved the oneplus.I am myself using a oneplus 6 and while comparing it with the T version.There are only slight differences apartment from the notch size battery capacity and  on screen fingerprint reader.I particularly doesn't feel for the need for a quad HD screen since the screen quality is amazing.They could have added bwtter camera modules and instead of the depth sensor , they could have put a telescopic lensSpeaker quality has improved from the 6 but they should have added stereo speakers.I know some are xomolaing about the jack but sooner or later everyone will start using Bluetooth headphones, just like touch screen phone made a revolution.The biggest upgrade that i personally feel is the 400mah increase in battery capacity.I never had any issues with the 6 but the 6t wouod easily last 2 days for a moderate user

Switched to this one from my iPhone 7 Plus. Though I faced issues at first I'm totally satisfied with the performance and battery life of the One Plus 6T.I can't comment on the camera cuz it's neither awesome nor poor. The photos are softer than the iPhone but when you compare the price of both it lives upto it's reputation.The fingerprint reader is good for the technology but I found face unlock to be more useful when my hands are wet. They could have included an. IR sensor like in the POCO since it's hard to unlock at night and the assist light is too bright.The most attractive thing is the awesome battery life and fast charging. I get easily 1.5 days charge is normal office use and moderate gaming and I charge it for one hour daily before office hours and it's good to go.I wish the price of the Bullets we're a little less cuz it would have made a world of difference with this phone when it comes to gamingI got it for 33K which makes it a bargain for the spec and build quality.Happy to be a part of the One Plus Team.

Lot of issues,1. Camera gets crashed frequently.2. Apps crash sometimes.3. Camera app is dead slow while loading.4. Picture qlty isn't as expected.5. Speakers are not good... Voice cracks with half the volume.6. Gallery crashes sometimes.

It's a very great phone with great specifications. Fast charging and great battery backup. Fingerprint reader works perfectly fine and the camera quality is awesome too. You won't regret after buying this phone. It has all the features that one looks in a good mobile. Additionally, the touch is very smooth and look of the phone is very smart.After using it for a very long time, i am listing some pros and cons,Pros:- Super-fast fingerprint sensor- Awesome display with tiny teardrop notch- Good Camera Quality- T-Mobile support- Upgradeable to Android PieCons:- Headphone jack is missing.- It has a type C jack and hence you have to use specific earphones. Like in other phones any 3.5mm jack earphones can be used but here its not the case.- Doesn't wireless charging

My earlier OP phone gave up on my a little while ago and I wasn't sure if I should wait for the 6T to launch or just go for another phone. I'm glad I waited. The OP 6T is a beast of a device. The screen is just beautiful and the gestures so smooth. Using the device is just a satisfying experience. The battery life is also incredible. Easily gets me through two days of average usage. The finger print reader is slightly slower compared to other devices with regular scanners, but its not something to be put off by. The only con I have about the device is the single downward facing speaker. It can easily be covered depending on how you hold the phone so not really a great experience while watching something especially in landscape mode. Otherwise, don't think twice about getting this phone. Just go for it.

I was extremely excited about the product and while I prefer ordered through Amazon gift card and bought it on the launch day. I was extremely dissapointed with Amazon. During the sale the offer showed 3/6 month no cost emi and then when I went ahead with 6 months my bank started to charge 13% interest saying we have already given no cost emi discount and now 13% will be applicable. Don't understand the logical behind it, if you are giving a discount why do you find ways to earn it back with false advertisement. Now, the offer has changed and says that's applicable only for 3 months. This really messed up my experience. I have been a one plus user and purchased the same through Amazon on multiple occasion, dissapointed to see the quality and commitment has gone so down so much.

Horrible thing happened to my phone: my screen blacked out and phone suddenly stopped working just after 15 days I bought it. I took it to the service center and they said it's some technical error and they erased all the data... I lost all my contacts and pictures and unfortunately I did not have back up. Wors experience ever. . I did not expect this from a good brand like one place. I'm so unhappy with this. I lost my valuable data. Never had such experience with any of the phone I used till now.... I also read reviews on Google and not only me but many customers have faced this same issue..so so disappointed

I had rated earlier 3 stars just because of the battery drain up. But lighting up all the stars just because the phone has regained its battery juices back and now clocking 24 hrs plus and stioll have more than 50% left with normal usage which was not earlier the case prior to an OS update and my inclusion of Greenify doze app and wake lock detector .My Ratings on the specs are a sunder1) Speed : 10/102) Looks : 10/103) OS 9.0 : 10/104)  Camera : 10/105) Battery : 8/106) Charging speed : 10/107) Support response on Twitter : 10/10.A great brand to look forward to which can give samsung and other brands a run for their money. Some Users may still feel otherwise but Its just my POV.

Does not use global standard power pin. It is big. U need to carry it, means uou cannot use others in case you forgot.Head set jack and space is not available. Mean you have tk use the oneplus specific adaptor if you want to use.Power charging is not that fast. It took me 3 hours to charged and already half is gone within 3 hours.Some of the app was not workingIt is diagonally 6.4. but actually some where near to 5.5 horizonal.Yhe finger print reader is overlapping the keyboard.  Many time finger print does not recognise.Do not recommend. Lost my huge money

Had audio issues . Asked for replacement

I was considering pixel 3xl, but believe me this is way more better than half a pixel 3xl(may be even better than a full one ..lol). This phone is super practical and is a real companion in your day to day tasks. The gestures are beautiful. RAM is so much that I guess whole OS would fit in making everything just spontaneous. Zero lag in any thing. The draw V to start torch is super handy. Camera might not be like pixel 3xl, but for a person who takes normal amount of photos, it is more than sufficient. You won't be unhappy at all with camera.It comes with screen protector preapplied. A very good case.No headphones - not a big deal(u probably will buy your own at some stage)Fingerprint sensor is like just a little bit under 1 second. But it won't make your life slow at all.If you can afford it and want an upgrade, buy it, period

Yesterday, I bought Oneplus 6T - 8GB RAM - 256 GB Storage, Mobile.1. I ordered for this phone on 02 November 2018 and as assured, Amazon delivered it yesterday.  Thanks to Amazon.I have started using it.  So far, so good.2. When I charge this Mobile, the Charging Light is not glowing.Is there a Charging Light in this Mobile?OnePlus company says 'No Charging Light' in this mobile.Thumbs Down not to have this basic feature in this model.3. The printed Quick Start Guide which came with this mobile is in Red Colour Paper with Black Colour  tiny font, making it too difficult to read during night even with good tubelight.4. This mobile is available only in two black colour variants.  They should at least make it available in White colour also.5. The weight of the Charging plug is more.  I feel it may be around 175 grams.Thanks.

I am an old one plus user who used one plus 3 until I planned to upgrade to this beauty. I will keep it short and this is my honest review and feedback.Pros:1. 3700 mAh battery2. Corning gorilla glass 6 protection3. Bigger storage that starts from 128 GB4. New night mode that works like charm5. Touch and look and feel looks super awesome6. Oxygen OS 9 and Android pie works sleek and super fast7. Hidden flash for selfies8. In display finger print scanner9. Water drop notch which makes the phone look beautiful10. Dash charge is superb as always11. Gaming is awesome. It's sleek and seamlessCons:1. Same hardware as one plus 6 with slightly bigger battery and finger print scanner in display2. No 3.5 mm Jack for headphones which is surprising. Come on OnePlus, you could have adjusted it somewhere for sure. But guys there is a dash to 3.5 mm adapter that comes in the box so it's covered somewhere so don't crib about it3. No dual speakers in this price range4. Same camera configuration as one plus 65. Same 845 processor as one plus 6. Well this is latest and they didn't have any option6. The phone is not dust or water resistant. That's bad OnePlus7. Price of the phone is slightly higher (should have been 3-4 k less)All in all this phone is an all-rounder. If you could live without 3.5 mm Jack and adjust with indisplay finger print scanner then just go for it as the phone is a perfect treat to all the mid to high end users of a smartphone. You will love it.

The first impressions - One plus 6t(8gb ram and 128 GB storage).Initially thought to get One plus 7 and let me wait for May 14 launch. I was using Apple iPhone 7 from last 3 years and still there were no lags.But due to no customisations and speaker problems, wanted to get something good.Heard about Amazon sale and didn't thought twice to get this beast at 31499 including SBI discount.Well the battery, screen, lots of geetures and finally the absolute catchy screen takes eye out of mouth.One plus 7 could have been good but will surely come at an extra 10k mark. So, I was happy with this.Transferring files from iPhone to One plus was quick due to One plus switch.Thanks to Amazon for delivering this in less than 24 hrs and in a much secure way as, they asked me the OTP to deliver the package and that was something new with Amazon. I am loving this.

i am writing this review after one month of usage..over al in this phone1 . we miss led notification light2. screen recording option3. App lock is not prefectly usfel to lock4. touch sreen sensor is not tht much effective n some times it wont opens5. face lock is not tht much effective.6. not giving headphone tht to giving so much high price.7. battery lifenis fair enough but not gud.main thing is  gud is1. 8gb ram2. 128 gb memory3. it never lags.4. works well in hight end games.5. charges the phone very soon.

There are many reviews from users as well as reviewers out there. Just my 2 cents:Pros:Incredible Battery life with the fastest charging system on the market.Screen is vibrant and has various colour modes to suit your preference.Performs like a champ with gaming loads such as Pubg and Asphalt.Slim and light though mandatorily needs a case as most of the construction is glass .Camera is a hit and miss sometimes, highly recommend the Pixel 3 camera app port. When it works well, the pictures are fantastic.Cons:Some minor bugs such as the accelerometer requires a shake sometimes to get orientation.The bokeh mode is a hit and miss with recognizing faces and objects.Build quality is top notch (Heh!) but fragile.If you're used to a 3.5mm jack, you will most certainly miss the jack.Never cared about wireless charging so that didn't really matter to me.Mono speaker.It may have a list of niggles but it will most definitely make you smile when you use it and still at the end of the day have 40% battery left.

My phone is not having any ringtone.this functionality is not working I have already reported and asked for replacement. Further the set was also not having the pin for sim. It's a terrible experience. Expect immediate action from Amazon and one plus team for replacement of my phone.

Finger print reader sometimes doesn't read the print, but honestly it's not a deal breaker. Work's absolutely fine most times. Camera quality is great, but in zooming in there's noise, again only in indoor conditions cuz the lighting is low.use the night mode here or the Google camera. Battery life is good,I noticed though while using the camera for sometime the battery drains, this happened just once till now, I will check a few times, so you can ignore this, maybe the camera app is calibrating. Rest, it is total beast if a phone, looks fab, super fast, super smooth,and gives you everything you'd want from a phone and more.

This is really nice product. There are certain drawback like no led notification and no always on display despite having smiled screen. But overall it is very nice and fluid to use. Camera are same as earlier. Night scape mode may not be the best but it still way better than anything else in this price bracket. Mirror black finish also hides the fingerprints to some extent which is also good. Performance and fluid Ness is something which has hooked me for first time for using OnePlus devices. And I must say that it is really fluid and battery life exceptional now with 3700 mah. With moderate usage I am always getting screen on time of anywhere between 6 to 7 hrs so with normal moderate use it will always last you for a day and half. In display fingerprint scanner may not be fastest and always accurate but it is still unique and serve the purpose. Overall a good clean android performance phone to have.

This phone is an all around performer. It excels well in all sections. Does the job for the money you pay.Rating:1) Camera - 7.5/10 ( 8/10 if google camera is installed).2) Screen- 9/103) Battery standby - 8/10 [ Average standby time- 38-42 hours ] [ Screen on time - 8-9 hours]4)Build Quality - 9/10 [ Looks gorgeous]5)Call Quality - 9/10 [ Good]6) FingerPrint sensor - 8/10 [ Performs well ]Cons:1) Lacks wireless charging even after Glass back.2) Lacks Ip certification [Not a deal breaker for me]3) Camera could have been better. I still don't understand how google pixel 3 performs well with single lens than the other smartphones in the industry. Default oxygen os camera app image processing algorithms have to be improved.4) Lacks SD card slot.5)Lacks stereo speakers [ Deal breaker ] although the single bottom firing speaker performs above average.Overall Rating : 8/10Verdict: Real Value for money smartphone with Oneplus Magic

OnePlus is the best when it comes to performance in Android. Much better than the pixel phones, which is a shame. I was using OP5 before this for a year and a half before I shattered the screen. So I decided to go for 6t now. To be honest I didn't want to buy a new phone since the old one worked as good as new with no slow downs.Coming to 6t, this is a powerhouse. Never faced a hiccup in any apps, the camera is above average, but I'm not a photography enthusiast. Gaming performance is epic! And it charges extremely fast thanks to Dash charging.The only downside to this phone is the slightly slower finger print sensor. You'll notice it if you're coming from older OnePlus devices, which had a lightening fast sensor. But it's nothing you can't get used to.The notch is one of the most subtle ones on the market.I would recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a new Android device.

One or the worst products ever by Oneplus. Highly disappointed. Was extremely excited for the product but the quality is no where near the expectations.Oneplus is know for providing value for money but this particular model is their biggest failure. Its better to buy any phone for 10k rather than spending so much on this.Got the phone on the very next day from launch and had a lot of issues in it. Got it replaced still I am facing a lot of issues. The phone's fingerprint scanner doesn't respond properly. It hangs sometimes. The phone gets warm when charged. The battery backup is not at all up to the mark.Even the Oneplus community is filled with complaints for the same product.Completely disheartening.

The Phone is Great. Just bought this phone in the Amazon Sale but at the new one plus 7 just launched felt cheated in terms of pricing at which i have bought this.

"Smart phone of the Year"Yeah below are the Pros and Cons to prove this.Pros -1. Best Android OS right now in Market. Oxygen OS is excellent and yet close to Android Vanilla OS. Its evolving very fast Thanks to OnePlus Community.2. Great Unibody Design. Its feels premium.3. Great In-Display Fingerprint (Yeah its new but its great).4. Amazing Battery Life. After minor increment to 3700 mah.5. Best Value of Money to get the "Flagship Experience" (Yeah they didn't Bragged about it but still it is The Best Premium Android phone right now)6. Best Camera of what you pay. Its great with some nifty feature like Night mode, lens integrated in Camera App.7. Regular update to at least 2-3 year as promised by Oneplus. ( No other OEM has ever gave ..i means except Apple/Samsung)Cons1. No Headphone jack, yeah with increased battery(from 3400 to 3700) you have to compromise with this.2. No improvement in Camera lens as compare to OnePlus6. But still the best in that price bracket.3. Metal is slippery and tend to get fingerprint very easy. Need to put in cover all the time.Thanks for Reading.

Bought mobile minutes after launch, using till date, really impressed with this one. Works like a charm. everyone talks positive content, let me point out few negatives i experienced in this (Not applicable to everyone i guess)....1)The in-display finger print display sometimes takes more time than it has to. so it can be said that a dedicated Finger Print sensor is better than this. Not that in display finger Print sensor is bad, but sometimes not very responsive. and i hate when at night time when i try to unlock and a WHITE BRIGHT SCREEN comes upon to detect my face for face-Unlock (Which can be disabled).2) The Camera quality is not that great AS EXPECTED, but its really good, but i expected a little more clarity.These two are the only Negative points i see. Rest of it, its a wonderful mobile and i'm having a lot of fun using it. i'd say BUY IT, coz there's no way you can get all the features available in this mobile for such a low price while in these days a mobile with high specs comes for a minimum of Rs 60,000. GO FOR IT.NOTE TO ONEPLUS :- Bro, take some time and come up with better looking and thinner bumper cases. Come on dude, we spending for you. My GODDD HUMAN. -_-#PreferSterioSpeakers

After using almost one week I can safely say its a great purchase.I had wait around 6 Month to purchase 8GB+256GB version in almost same price at which I had purchased OnePlus 3T at its launch.Here is my quick review.1. Fantabulous Screen: Beyond doubt screen is the USP of this device.Big screen with finger scanner on it , Just great.I  like reading a lot and I feel awesome on kindle reading on it.  Thanks to screen calibration feature colour reprodution is very good.I like DCI-P3 mode.2. Bigger battery: 3700mAH ia just a great battery, I got around 8Hrs SOT on heavy use.loved it.3. Speed: On 845 SOC no any second thought abut speed.4. Gesture Integration: there are 3way in which u can use the screen, thanks to Geasture integration feture on it.5. Camera: As usual Camera is awesome.I have seen in xda people go for GCAM ported version.But as it integrated Noghtscape mode on it.I really don't find any use of that now.6.  Symmetry: I like the symmetricity of the phone, I mean symmetrical around notch, then dual speaker placement and dual back camera placement.CON:I terribaly miss audio jack, as I have to carry USB-C converter always.Little slow on screen finger print scanner, but still it is fast enough.Face unlock is great however.

Initial review:Pros:1. Looks amazing2. Superb display with tear drop notch3. Inbuilt call recording feature4. Indisplay fingerprint sensor (but slow and inaccurate sometimes)Cons:1. Average camera quality2. User interface needs more hard work to compete with samsung's interface for eg you cant make folders in apps section. Folders can only be made on homescreen etc3. No wireless charging4. Not complete water and dust proof5. Speaker's loudness is not as good as samsung phones have6. No headphone jack7. No expandable memory8. Midnight black (matte finish at back) not available for 6gb phone9. No ultra wide camera10. No led notification light11. No front flash12. Bit expensiveStill a great value proposition.

First of all I would like to share the seller feedback, the delivery was awful by Amazon.But it was overruled by Oneplus, means oh my god, what a phone, awesome phone , nicely packed.Display 5 *Camera 5 *Battery 5 *Value 5 *Interface 5 *Overall 5 *Most important part is migration of data from old to new, thanks to oneplus switch app, oh it's too cool.My overall experience with first Oneplus is seems so good.Need some improvement , for e.g. music player and video player is missing.Let me use for few more months and then again revised or repost the review.

Switching over from my Iphone 8 to Oneplus 6t.1 - SpeedYes, Oneplus claims the truth that you're going to "Unlock Speed" with this one. The face unlock and brand new in display fingerprint in this phone is insanely fast.2- HardwareThe built quality of the phone gives you a very premium feel, glass back , amazing curved design, oled screen and teardrop notch can give a bummer to any other premium smartphone in the market.3- ProcessorDamn, I love this one, Snapdragon 845 and 8GB of RAM makes it one of the fastest phones in the world right now, get ready for an amazing never lagging gaming experience and user interface.4- SoftwareAndriod 9, Pie and Oxygen OS makes the interface of the phone look beautiful, and it looks beautiful to me as I've been using apple for past two years with same interface. Gestures, customizations and various other oxygen os features give you a very good in-phone experience.5- CameraAmazing for low light photography, I haven't test the camera much, would edit my review after testing it for sometime.CONS1- It would be great if Oneplus launches phones with IP water resistant certificate and Wireless Charging from next time.2- Include the Type C bullet earphones inside the box itself. They're out of stock on amazon.

Great device. Amazing speed. 8gb ram and superior processor work at lightning fast speed. I play a lot of online games and with this device I can open multiple games without worrying about device slowing down. On my previous phones, the games always caused issues like heating of device, device becoming abnormally slow and rapid battery discharge. This device solved all my issues. I have used fast charging devices as well but the speed of charging of this device is the best among any I have come across till date.

Oneplus 6T is the best phone you can get with less than half the price of iPhones.All the features are really good. Oneplus has been consistent in upgrading their brand & added new features into their phones. I am skipping the PROs of the phone(which is a huge list, already described by many ppl)CONs:Fingerprint sensor - slower than previous models + you need the screen to be switched on before using the fingerprintHeadphone jack removed & extension chord is provided. This is a big let down!Tq

I owned a Samsung earlier and bought OnePlus 6T of double the cost, recently. To be honest Samsung raised my expectations and OnePlus misses features like:1.You cannot charge and use headfones at the same time2.With headfones on, the ringer volume remaons same and blasts your ears. "Smart phone" doesnt detect it and lowers it despite the Earphone settings.3.Somehow the screen is quite attracted to dust and settles in gaps between the screenguard and phone cover. Make it dust resistant.However the camera and UI of this fone is definitely much better. Sound and call quality too is good. I expected much much more and now i know which brand i should go for, next.

My sister is not a tech savvy person. She didn't want to spend a lot of money. Her iPhone broke twice. So she was sick and tired, asked me for a suggestion and we purchased this for her. Right off the bat, the setup process was easier than expected. All her contacts came through immediately, she found the phone big but not so big that she could not handle it. She was initially worried about using such a big phone but now almost 2 months later, she never even talks about her iPhone. She is a person who works daily and has to report her location to her bosses sometimes working late till 1-2AM and this phone works perfect for her. The screen though it is not as gorgeous as a Samsung s9, it has its own advantages. The customisation, battery life, the fact that this comes with a case, the ease of use have all won my sister over and maybe she will never go back to iOS. For this reason, I want to give the phone a perfect 5 stars. I personally use a s9 plus but if I had to go to a different phone, it would be either the Mate 20 Pro or this. Why not? Did I say it is delightful that this ships with inbuilt 128GB? AMAZING.

It's been a month since I am using it. So here's my findings.Pros:1. Screen is awesome. Notch is so small and fluidic that it doesn't bother and looks cool.2. Fast charger works well. For 100% charge it takes about an hour and battery lasts easily for a whole day.3. Camera quality is just awesome. There are thousands of videos for comparison of camera with other brands, but let me tell you such minor details which you'll get in almost double priced phones, Are those phones worth of money?4. It comes with good quality screen protector and back cover. You can use it directly from the box.Cons:1. I had some issues with camera application. Sometimes it just doesn't work.2. The phone is not light weight.3. In screen finger print looks cool, but it's not very fast. It takes time to unlock the phone. And obviously not very accurate. Sometimes I was forced to go by security PIN to unlock, because it couldn't recognize my finger print.Conclusion:Considering price point, this is the best deal you should go with. Its worth every rupee.

It's simply a burdenless phone.Very user friendly and the oxygen os user interface is ineffably smooth.Nice touch of elegance and strength.Touch delay is almost zero and in performance it's a real life hero.Beauty performance and simplicity are the distinct features of this dark knight.Fast and furious android experience mesmerized  me and now it is an inseperable limb of my digital life!I love it because I have no other choice.Hope one plus make it more featuristic and usable because it's not only their business but also their social responsibility as this is the only brand which thinks not only to maximise the profit of the organisation but also the utility of the loyal and precious customers of them them.Thank you Amazon for this wonderful product as their business partner and thanks to One Plus for their deep emotional involvement in the one plus community and yielding their positive response always in favour the consumers.

Worst product not even that much worth that it costs waste of money

Pros:Processor (at par with the best smartphones available currently, great for high end gaming and multi tasking)Display (great resolution)Looks (very premium)Battery Life (excellent fast charging, an hour's PUBG play sees a battery loss of merely 15%)Sound quality (Single firing speaker does the job well)In-display fingerprint scanner (after the 1st update it works perfectly well each time and it's lightning fast and the animation is a stunner)Face-recognition unlock (Best is class, works in milliseconds even in low lighting conditions)Cons:Camera is a disappointment (there are lower value phones whose cameras are much better, nightscape mode is okay if you have very stable hands, use a stand)Mirror back is a finger print magnet (impossible to use without a case)Omission of the 3.5mm headphone jack (using the dongle is an embarrassment)8GB RAM variants are extremely overpriced (Race with Apple will cause OnePlus to lose)

i have all edition of one plus mobile. i also have 6t as well. so i feel i can justify some issue.i feel 6t perform better than mclaren edition. camera is damm slow than 6t or any earlier edition.i really dont feel any difference in performance with 6t. to be honest i feel cheated.finger and face recognition is slow as well with comparing 6t as well.first time i truly feel betrayal by one plus

Upgraded from OnePlus 5T1. Battery Life Has Improved a lot thanks for the upgrade OnePlus.2. Camera Quality has improved, I was missing the OIS but now nothing to Worry.3. The Water Droplet Notch is not a Hindrance at all. The display quality is what one should be.4. After the last Update the Screen Unlock Has become Even Faster. I really don't find a difference in the speed between the Physical Finger print scanner and this Indisplay one. It's equally Fast.5. The Speaker even after being a Mono Gives Really Good Listening experience.6. OVER ALL A MUST BUY / UPGRADE.

So many reviews are already available.. not sure my review is going to make any difference.. still.. :)The best feature is definitely the great battery life and dash charge.  I have gifted this phone to my better half and she is very happy with this feature. Her earlier phone was tested and trusted companion for four years - OnePlus One.I am using OnePlus 5 for last one and half years. So it is very clear that we are fanboys-girls of this great products.The photography quality is pretty good and the pro mode can be very interesting to use; if you have the time to tinker with it.The sound quality is also very good; though i prefer to hook it up to the bluetooth speakers we have at home.Above all the basic phone functions like the reception/ data/ call quality are perfect. The screen quality is awesome (much better than my OP5).Overall a perfect phone under 35K.I bought it under exchange scheme against old OnePlus phone and extra card discount. it made a pretty decent deal. INR 33,349 plus another 1500 cash back on card...

[N.B. By not talking into account the price as these three devices belong to different price segments.]OnePlus 6T vs Poco F1 vs Redmi Note 7 Pro1. Where is OP6T (Fajita) Better?:- OLED Display, Gorilla Glass 6 Protection, Oxygen OS, Videography, NFC and 20 Watt Fast Charge.2. Where is 6T identical?:- Sound Speakers Output, USB 2.0, Battery 3700 mAh, Network Connectivity, Sensors, Storage UFS 2.1 and Weight.3. Where does 6T lacks?:- Under Display Fingerprint Scanner, Lack of 3.5 Headphone Jack.Now Cameras:Still Photography in Daylight: Redmi Note 7 Pro's photos are sharper, has more details than OP6T and colours are better more true to life, probably it's due to Sony IMX 586 Exmor RS Sensor.Nightlife Photography: RN7Pro and OP6T both capture almost same Nightmode photos with GCam and Stock Camera, despite having OIS in OP6T.Selfie: Poco F1 selfies are a little bit better than OP6T and RN7PRO.Videography: 4K 60fps with decent stabilization and slow-motion OP6T records better videos.Conclusion: At ₹31,499 OnePlus 6T great/super value for money smartphone mainly due to its UI Oxygen OS and Display. I absolutely adore them. ✌️

So this is my first time writing a review about anything , normally i read and watch reviews given by other people but this phone is getting a lot of criticism .The reason might be the design the not change in hardware and other things.But people don't realize that this phone was not made for the people who owned the one plus 6 ,it was for the people who were upgrading form a one plus 3 or 3t or 5 .Me being a user of one plus 3t absolutely love one plus foe their software and hardwarewhen they had launched the one plus 3t it was not a major upgrade over the 3 but a phone for the people who were looking to move into the one plus ecosystem ,it had the same design and almost the same specs (sanpdragon 821).Now coming back to the main topic the reviewthe design is a minor upgrade over the last modelas the notch is smaller and there is no headphone jack (the hardest of choices require the strongest of wills)i don't mind the removal of headphone jack as i really wanted to buy the one plus wireless bullets but they are still not available and I had to buy the type c bullets instead of them.The hardware is good but could have been better i.e in the camera they could have given a secondary wide angel lense .the haptic feedback could be better .Now the software we all now that oxygen os is one of the greatest crearion of one plus as it is optimized and snappy at the same time but there the are few things that i would like inculded in the software like manual video mode and a refresh ti the text message app.Now there are some things that i love to the use of Android pi , the inscereen finegeprint , night mode .There are also a few tiny deatils lik if you chek incoming vibration pattern they have new names for every pattern .This one plus always holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely love this phone and i would recommend this if you're looking for an update( but not an update over the 6 )

I'm not happy with Amazon I got phone without charger n earphone. N I see now the phone is 280000 es only. I'm really not happy with OnePlus n Amazon u should upgrade my phone I tried many times to contact Amazon by no responce

Being a tech savvy person, I have owned a Galaxy S3, iPhone 6 and was using a Galaxy S8 until I replaced it with a OnePlus 6T. It was my first experience of trying a smartphone out of my comfort zone (a samsung or an apple).OnePlus 6T has met all my standards• Premium phone (both look and feel) at the best price• Screen resolution is good• The battery life is amazing. To be exact, I watched Brooklyn 99 for an entire day (10 hours) on the Netflix app• The processing speed is mind blowing. 0 lag• Camera both front and rear are super amazing with potrait modes. Night feature for night photography takes time to process but I'll say the picture is worth the waitNothing can be perfect, some negatives• On screen fingerprint takes time to open and struggles to work with dirt on the screen or a fat tempered glass• Night feature takes a lot of time to process the photo• No health app to monitor the steps. In-built pedometer is something I look for in a smartphone• Phone is heavy but battery life compensates the struggleI am really happy with the phone and would suggest most of you to buy it. It'll be foolish right now (November, 2018) and spend that kind of money to buy an apple, a samsung or a pixel unless you are a die hard fan of those smartphone. I respect your opinion.

Pretty good product1)Very GoodCameraPerformance of deviceBattery , since not much into game and mostly video watching, internet and calling so pretty good battery lifeUI: clean android experience and no extra appFinger print login: pretty fast not measured in second but very fast. Only thing to make sure that while registering need to do it carefully from all anglesConcern:1) one observations is that  camera crashes when open first time but then it works fine and no issue in photo. Also if run in night mode entire phone hangs and can't do anything2) having issue in casting Prime video or Jio inema video or Netflix on TV. My previous phone worked fine .This issue is raised in forum also but no solution as of now

They made a discounted sale for old product and launched a new product with a lower pric than even the discounted price for old product.Very dissatisfied and not enjoying

What a phone! I have been using it since the past few weeks. Here's my experience:Pros:- Battery life for over 16-18 hrs on an average with screen time of 4-5 hrs plus. This is the best I have seen so far, more so impressive with a screen size of 6.4". So you won't need to charge it during the day mostly. Also, notice a near linear drain until the last juice.- Speed is fantastic. Not seen a single clipping or lag so far. I need to catch on my speed infact ! Games like ashphalt play completely lag free! What more do you want and at this price point ! Hence no need of frequent restarts ! ,😅👍- On screen finger print : Quite unlike many critics, I do not see any issues here. It does take a while to get used to it. Acceptable speed for login/unlock. Its one cool feature to show off,😀-  Dual 4G feature on the 6T is a true icing on the top especially for those who use Jio 4G LTE SIM used as a secondary data.- Display is good with standard 1080 resolution,  but not the best. There are better out there in the market. More so,  with the bundled screen guard, images and videos do not exactly standout like the Samsung's Super AMOLED displays, which I have used before. I my take off the screen guard one day and check out but for now it remains put on the brand new phone!- Camera - Sharp and well above avergae photos with the primary camera. Videos are good but the  audio capture is outstanding. Nightscapebis very  effective. And then there is the pro(manual mode) which is completely customisable, left to your skill with the lens. I have still to get a handle on that one and hence cannot comment as yet.  Secondary camera is also nice. Only,  I have some trouble taking selfies with the slim form factor, and get a feel that I am missing out on the larger frame. I may be mistaken here though.ConsJust a few :- No "One hand operation"- You miss the headphone socket. OnePlus store sells decent headphone (bullet) with USB C plug. You will need one unless you are happy carrying the discerning coverter.- Status icon list is limited to a few. Not sure why? Is it due to teardrop notch?  You need to mostly go an additional touch to pull down and view the usual list of icons typically on the status bar. I find it slightly inconvenient and irritating.Nothing more to crib about!Overall a great phone from OnePlus!

So I’ve had the OnePlus 6T for a good month now and I think it’s time for a review of the device.Some background – I wouldn’t call myself a fanboy but I’ve owned all OP phones except for the 3 series. I find their performance to budget ration incredible and while they’ve had problems till OP2 with mediocre hardware, OP5 was the best android experience I’ve had in quite a bit. Then they followed up with the 6 which stuttered a bit out of the box, but they’ve managed to iron out the kinks and now is definitely close to the Pixel when it comes to usability. No hyperbole.Anyway, coming to this phone, it is definitely one of the best android phones out in the market at this time. The 6 was a good step forward, but I wanted to wait for the 6T and so got this instead. Pretty much everyone here has talked about the specs and the water drop front camera, so I’ll talk about quality of life with this device for over the period.The exterior has never been exposed to the elements owing to the silicone cover that came bundled with the phone. It is a gorgeous looking device with typical OP design hints. People have always asked me what OP device it is – meaning OP has already established itself as one of the better looking manufacturers of mobile phones.The camera is fantastic. I have attached a few images but you can’t make out the difference when the resolutions is scaled down. If I’m being brutally honest, I’d say this is still a few notches below the big players, Pixel and iPhone X. But it’s good enough to blow almost any other phone out of the water.One Plus is a fantastic brand and I urge you to give it a shot – for me, it has been one of the best Android experiences ever.

This is my first experience with one plus. Good camera, better performance, good screen quality but phone little bit heavy. Go for it.

I want to start of by praising Amazon's delivery for this product. I recieved the order barely 24 hours after I placed it. The delivery associate was well behaved and completed my exchange purchase smoothly.First of all, I would like to say I think I got this at the lowest price possible, around 30,000.For the price I paid and the features this one has I am completely satisfied with what I have purchased.The camera is good, the speakers on the phone are loud, the screen is full HD and the finger print scanner which is embedded in the screen is beautiful.The really aren't any visible cons with the device already having come out of the beta and early testing phase.One of my best purchases.

i had buyed 6t mobile today and i had puttedlock to it and  it had worked for 10 min and after 10 min ph is not opening lock and it is telling incurrect pin and appearing as dummy ph display so plz dont buy this kind of cheap ph friends i had suffered lot and i went to service center to solve my problem they r telling that we dont have this soft ware u directly contact to customer service they wil solve your problem they r telling like that so plz dont buy this kind of stuppid company phones

Did not get a physical bill device is good

Oneplus 6T is absolutely gorgeous. For the price range, no other device can outperform the Oneplus. Looking so premium, perform amazingly fast literary no logo can be seen any of the normal apps its loads in a blink of eye when the finger tip once touches the icon. Camera is very appreciable but not upto the performance of highend flagships like pixel or IPhone Xs, but it does a very reasonable job for the money we are paying. Many reviews can be seen that the speakers are not stereo and its bad, i don't think so, its loud and clear. The Android PIE customised OxygenOS is good and neat which gives a feel like stock android while its perfectly customised for so many good features that lacks in many of the stock android smartphones but it should also be noted that Oxygen is not perfect by all means i reported some bugs in the alert slider, downloading huge apps from playstore, headphone ringtone volume issue but hopefully they are giving timely updates hence clearing bugs out of it. Battery is decent, for a device having SD845 and 6 gigs RAM and large Amoled Display a full day is big enough but I am a really heavy user playing PUBG for hours, streaming youtube, browsing, FB, whatsapp, downloads and full time 4G data ON and also have dual sim setup so i need to hit the charger twice a day but the charger is amazingly fast, i just go for a bath or having a snack and back boooyah.. battery charged to more than 75% its enough till i sleep. And finally the Amoled Display, it's not upto the displays of Samsung's Note series or Galaxy series but trust me its really nice, the tear drop notch and very thin chin and bezels gives makes the display more appealing, i put a decent beach wallpaper from Wallpapers Craft and sometimes i can't take my eyes from the display its so satisfying for the eye's. Indisplay Fingerprint scanner works fast with a nice animation, and the lack of headphone jack and wireless charging i don't care about it.

The One Plus McLaren edition is amazing no doubt about that the only issue I have is the warranty card and pin ejector are missing from the package box. I didn't shoot the unboxing video assuming there won't be any problem.So the only concern of mine is whether the warranty card will be provided or not; if not then at the service center what document should I provide for any services that I would be needing during the warranty period.

Pathetic service by Amazon they delivered defective phone which is having heating issues, app crashes, phone constantly hanging and battery issues.Amazon not even replacing the defective device they have delivered

I'm writing this after a complete one day use. First of all mobile looks very premium in hands. AMOLED display with notch is quite awesome. Sound output quality and call quality is good. Battery life for minimal users will be 1 and Half to 2 days. For users who browse and play games will be one day. 0-70% quick charge will happen in first 30-35 minutes and overall it takes 55mins to an hour time for full battery. An immediate security patch for better enhancements will be available. Camera quality is good pictures are coming out like awesome in all the modes. Upgraded from OnePlus 3 after two years of usage to 6t. Bought mobile for 25744 after exchange and other discounts. Phone is good at speed. Ram optimization is nice. Total available space will get is 113 GB out 128GB. You have OTG support. The Oxygen OS is terrific with customization. Will be having a default applied screen protector and also back case which is good available in box. One thing which I have noticed is the download speed from Jio SIM is bit slow for first 3 to 5 hours. After that don't know it picked up really well. Go for this phone when you need all the features at a minimum cost with premium feel.Will let you know more after usage.

First of all, I had a Samsung S8 and I wanted to buy a new phone. So, I started searching and read a lot of posts on what is the best phone available right now. I had a few options. LG Q7+, poco, mate 20(not yet released) etc. But after a lot of speculation and hype I went on with the OnePlus 6t.Pros:1) Good screen(not the best in the business though)2) Solid Build Quality3) Premium feel and a good looking phone4) Solid battery(1 and a half day of regular use)5) Decent camera.(cannot compare it to the pixels and the iPhones of the world)6) Good value for money.7) Android pie8) Dash charger.(best in the business)Cons:1) A little problematic with the Bluetooth connectivity. My old phone S8 had no problems when using a Bluetooth headset. But there is a small issue in this phone. I have to restart the phone again to get it working properly.2) Speaker quality.3) On screen fingerprint scanner.(Accuracy-7/10) and a little slow(hopefully software updates will fix it).

This is my second OnePlus phone, after a very bad experience with the previous one and I took it on the hope they have learnt lessons and improved, but it isn't, it's again the same worst feeling. I don't know how to call it flagship killer it's actually a flagship loser.1* rating is for the following reasons:Camera: A35K flagship phone which only takes pics in one mode. It so worse that even the basic modes and stickers are missing. The camera does not even allow to change resolution (Megapixel), even a 5K phone does that. I went through some forums and people suggested to use Google camera or other third-party camera apps.Screen Quality: The phone came with pre-installed screen guard (off course with bubbles and a warning to only use official screen guard for the finger print to work properly), just wondering why does a flagship killer need a 100 Rs worth (or 20 Rs Chinese equivalent) screen-guard?  Prospective buyers just think of it, is it because of poor screen quality? cost cutting? Please note I spent exactly 6200 Rs to replace the screen of my first One plus phone, which again cracked 2nd time, after which I totally discarded the phone. One plus hasn’t yet learned the lesson and again released a phone with substandard screen quality.Dust-Finger print Magnet: The back is made of Mirror back, it attracts not just dust but is a serious finger print magnet. Keep it on table for 2 min or hold it just for 1 min after thoroughly cleaning with a  soft cloth, it turns dirty in no time. The pre-installed screen guard also attracts too much dust. Why does a manufacturer himself give a free a back case, why? Just think of it, before purchasing.Low Battery Capacity: 3700 mAh is too low for a phone with such a specification.Poor Battery Backup: The battery backup is not so good, losing 20-30% battery overnight in idle mode. My Normal usage in a day 30-40 min calls, 1-2 hours of apps usage, 1-2 hours of music and 15-20 mins of forward videos without any games, battery hardly lasts.Poor Service Quality and expensive repair costs: One plus service quality is too poor, in hand experience from my first phone. They have hardly 2-3 proper service centres in big cities, the Queue's and waiting times are long and on top the spares or screen replacement costs are exorbitantly high. Just enquire the screen replacement costs from service centre before buying this phone.Free Labour: Please don't be a free labour to OnePlus. For every issue with OnePlus, you have to go through 10's of forums (including the official OnePlus forum) 100's of threads and 1000's of replies from other users and find out yourself how to fix the issue. On top of it we provide free feedback (actually free labour) so that they improve their next one. Just think of it are you buying a phone or doing a free labour ship to OnePlus, why Should we waste our time and money to do something, which one plus should do themselves?

It got to know it after my purchase of one plus 6t. So please dont buy it. It is nowhere comparable to iphones. It is a premium phone from a chinese company. And the worst part is that my phone's screen has been broken falling just four feet from ground. Despite having screen guard and one plus case, the screen got broken and replaced today from one plus store, C.P. New delhi. The best part is that the ambience of store was fantastic, the screen replacment was flawless. lots of buddies came with same problem. It took just under nine thousand bucks UNDER WARRANTY.

Let's not waste time.Using it from 2nd Nov. 256GB ModelSound is not noteworthy just like any other 10k-15k phones. Dual speaker slot is just for show. There is only one speaker the other one is mic. Just confirmed from OnePlus team.Picture is just good. Reading mode is really useful for bookworms. Much like kindle readability.Battery is no doubt awesome and so is the charging time. First time when I charged the phone, it took 1 hr 15 mins from 20% to 100%. Next time it took 40 mins.More reviews coming up soon.

Everyone knows about OnePlus phones.. They're good. But for the money, I just expected longer battery and better camera quality. Sometimes the pictures are quite hazy. Not sharp like some other phones. Having issues with WhatsApp calls, they're getting dropped. Have come across lot of WhatsApp based issues with other OnePlus users too. Hope the makers do something about this glitch. But it's a smooth phone. Don't regret buying..

Oneplus always rocks! Been using it since Nov 2, 2018, I just love it! I'm oneplus user since 2015, camera has improved a lot, still cannot match Iphone quality. yet, compared to all other phones(except Iphone), 6T camera is way too good. Audio quality, Performance and battery life are awesome!Only con I see is this phone is heavy.

Completely satisfied with the phone, already multiple reviews have been given on the phone so I would touch on my personal opinion alone. Amazon has to take care of the package delivery. The box was crushed almost on all sides. It's high time they focus on package quality. Zero star for this to Amazon, you're lucky if the phone comes in a single piece because the way the box looked I was really worried but luck was on my side. Thank God !!!*Pros*1. Premium feel2. Camera the best3. Speed, it is really fast enough4. User friendly OS and latest Android5. Battery and dash charging (15mins tips from 0 to 75% of battery)6. In display finger print is fast once you get used with right angle and spot. Trust me it is fast7. Annoying notification light is gone. As an alternative one tap on screen gives all notification*Cons*1. 3.5mm jack missing, may be we'll get used to it2. The dongle provided for 3.5mm jack is very thin, the wire is easily tend to break. Could have been thicker like the charger wire3. YouTube and play store often doesn't work with WiFi whereas via mobile data it works flawlessly. Hope an update will rectify this issue** Amazon put some quality time on package department**

I have used iphones and latest was pixel 2XL. Was very sceptical about buying this one plus 6t thinking it might be just a Chinese phone.But to my surprise I was wondering how actually we are being cheated by Google and Apple for such high pricing for their flagships.This phone is just having all the right things at such a affordable price.Pros:Dual simVolte and good WiFi and network receptionBattery lasts for one and half days - goodDisplay is having good screen to body ratioCamera is better and not awesome when compared to google PixelNo heating up or hanging issuesSlim and handyCons:Display is not having that much clarity when compared to Samsung or other flagshipsConclusion:Yup. This is a phone made with so much sense and thinking. Don't waste money in spending for brands. Go for this phone. It is a package with all features with good pricing and will never disappoint you. Thanks for reading.

The display is bright and has got some really good colors. Sound quality is decently loud(just be careful not to cover up your speaker). Since I got my hands on my phone day before yesterday, I haven't given it a rest. After a day's use with reasonable screen brightness(about 75%) and screen on time just above 5 hours, I ended up with 50% juice left. And the warp charging speed is just as promised. I was surprised to see that the battery drained only up to 3% over night. Nightscape in the stock camera is not as good as that in the pixel 3. But I downloaded the pixel 3 gcam mod and it's working just fine.

Loved it, I bought OnePlus Six 3 months ago, I Just now purchased the New One Plus 6t and At this price this Phone is par from even any phone in India , I have used Y1 Y2 Note 5 Pro and Even Mi 3s pri e but Now comparison at all, You Will get the worth of your money.

Pros: Works as described, battery is much improved over a OnePlus 3T which is what this phone has replaced. Much smoother to operate too.Cons: The display is not great compared to other mobiles that are in similar price range or slightly more expensive.Other thoughts: Not a worthwhile upgrade from a OnePlus 5T which is also what i own

The phone is absolutely fine. But its the Amazon which started to disrespect customers.Initially they did all sorts of support to their customers, but now providing worst service.I prebooked the phone on oct 15th bullet earphones offer, and as per the terms bought it on nov 2 ( despite having plently of launch offers on nov 1 ) i even confirmed with the customer care on having launch offer and pre booking offer. They told me to pick either one. So i decided prebooking headphones.Now after 15 days they are telling am not eligible for prebookinh offers with silly reason.Worst service and very disspointing.

I was using 3T from past 2 years and my experience was Good, But this phone is not working fine, it hangs a lot and I can see a black and white screen with dots on it often. The camera quailty is okish because you see grains in the backcamer images which is annoying. I am not happy with this Product. The fact that this is a new piece and it hangs a lot bothers me because it has not been a month also. the fingure print scanner is also not that great 3t was way more better.

Review on the forst week:Me using Android didn't find any added advantages over other mobiles that i have used like vivo, mi, honor, lenovo etc.,Yes, the major is speed, display and image quality.Onscreen fingerprint sensor is working much slower when hand has very little moisture even. Not satisfied with that.Whyswitch for ring/vinraye/silent is given couldn't understand.Had played a simulator game for 15 mins and phone heated up like hell. Have to check more on this issue.Packing of one plus, the elegant and stylish look are the pros pleased me. Other than that, i found OnePlus 6t as normal Android phone from other makers.

I purchased a 6GB, 128GB phone. I m using the dual camera lens for the first time and noticed some objects getting out of focus in the auto mode. Sound quality is same as before with very little improvement. However, OLED display is certainly good with natural colors. The phone came with pre attached screen guard which absorbs lot of prints requiring frequent cleaning. In screen fingerprint sensor works well. Face recognition is snappy. One plus phones are fast and don't lag like Samsung/Iphone even after 2 years of use.

I order my new OnePlus 6t device on 1st November and it shipped fast and deliver fast in an excellent packing by Amazon , I just unboxed , I am being studying with my phone for nearly 10days then I realized thatThis phone is awesome that i can ever imagine in my life , interms of looks : it's looks stunning , (build  ,speed, performance like a "bull"), price is little high in my opinion , battery is excellent compared to OnePlus 6 , in terms of camera the rear or back camera is outstanding but front camera is not that great, so guy's if you are looking for a selfie centric phone then don't choose this , else just close the eyes and buy it  , finally the indisplay finger print sensor works perfectly 98 times and better than any indisplay finger print sensor in the world ,Amazon & OnePlus fanz

Camera is just average despite dual lens and what not. If your reason to upgrade is camera then don't. I moved to 6T from my 3T and that is not the best decision. Compared to 3T's aluminium body 6T is all glass which is very fragile. 6T is bulky like hell. Battery life is very good. On my normal usage it lasts around 2 days. Speed is good but that also depends on internet speed.

I always wanted to have OnePlus phone and when they announced 6T, then I made up my mind that I will buy this phone.I got it without pre-booking offer so no type c bullet earphones. But hats-off to Amazon for the before the time delivery again.Now for phone -1. New in-screen fingerprint sensor - Very slow as compare to normal fingerprint sensor.2. Battery - 3700mAh makes difference and with proper use you can get approx 1 day of charge time.3.  Notch - Tear drop notch is good as compared to other notch sizes and you get more screen size.No major or unknown issue yet discovered, its a good phone in this range.My rating - 9/10

One plus 6t was marketed as best smartphone of the market but it's not. I have used this for 3-4 months to tell difference. Before this I've used MI phone and they are better when it comes to user interface.Cons1. On screen fingerprint sensor is horrible. Face detection is horrible. Night time u have to use ur code to unlock ur phone.2. If you have google chromecast then one plus is a bad choice. U cannot caste amazing time video on TV. U can caste device but it'll show blind screen. Also u cannot watch HD quality on Netflix.3. It has major glich for sound. Sometimes u cannot reduce or increase sound it'll stay the same. If u r listening song and u connect bullet headphones then sound doesn't transfer to headphone, it'll continue from mobile speakers. Also it has lot of issues with Bluetooth, when disconnected from car Bluetooth device there is problem again with sound button. U have to restart ur phone to make it workable. The problem with is sound button is actually software problem and it's very annoying.4. It doesn't have IR sensor for universal remote. Which is very useful.Pros1. It's very fast.2. Camera is good quality.3. Speed charging is very good. I get full battery within 40 minute charge.Overall I am bit disappointed using this phone because they have not done proper research on user interface. Doesn't give premium feeling. My previous MI phone was very good in that case. Absolutely not worth 40k.

Amazing Piece of ART! Oneplus really never hesitate to innovate, was little worried while buying the OnePlus 6T , thought it would be large in hands as it's 6.41' , But when I opened the package and hold it in my hands , its was a feeling that you have the best of best tech in hands, it's amazing to see the form factor that OnePlus 6T came up with. It's one of best flagship OnePlus 6T ever built. Go for it , believe me you won't regret and there won't be any company atleast in 2019 which would be coming with a more Impressive design than that of OnePlus 6T.No Matter what Apple and samsung would do , they won't be able to deliver such an impressive designed handset!Features :-1) Good looking2) Best Design3) screen unlock4) wow charger5) back cover provided by OnePlus 6T........................................All Wow Phone. Thanks Amazon and Thanks OnePlus 6T.

Looks- has a premium feel and look. Outer cover is not the cheap one you usually get with a phone, it looks premium too.Processor-Amazing processor and RAM efficiency.Oxygen OS- pretty good and smooth.Camera- Photos have brilliant colour and texture. Night mode requires lot of improvement.Fingerprint- improvable. Make sure you choose the right fingerprint animation, some make it feel faster, while some make it  feel extremely slow. Personally, I feel the McLaren fingerprint sensor makes it feel considerably fast.Diaplay- amoled display is one of the best in the market. Extremely pleasing to the eye.Battery- battery life is poor, but dash charging is amazing. The dash charging compensates the sub par battery performance.Overall- a well priced flagship with its pros and cons, recommended if you can't afford the more pricier flagships.

Using this phone for week now.Mark my words "I use my phone heavily". I play a lot of games and the battery is amazing. I leave my house with full charge at 7am and I return around 9pm and I would still have 20% left which is amazing considering how much I use my phone.The only area where the phone isn't good at is the FINGERPRINT. The fingerprint fails to recognise at times but if u have face unlock, U don't have to use the fingerprint. The face unlock is so fast that by the time you place ur finger on the fingerprint, it would have unlocked the phone.All other features are fine and amazing.Please don't compare it with the flagships from Samsung or Apple. I mean to say this phone lags behind those flagships in areas like camera, IP ratings and a few other features.

Had to return the entire handset due to faulty charger. The replacement unit was good. Phone was compared with iphone 6s and Honor 10. In all aspects it is better than iPhone 6s and even iphone 8 in some aspects but speed wise it was same as Honor 10. The image quality is same as on the honor 10 in some cases honor 10 images were better. Video picture quality i felt was better on H10 but the overall stabilisation is much better on Oneplus 6t. Where it beats the h10 is the selfie camera. Battery life slightly less than H10 due to screen size. Screen quality is only slightly better than H10. If this helps.

Amazing Phone.. I Recommended you to if you have 40 Thousands You can Go with OnePlus 6T. and UNLOCK THE SPEED 😀

It's one of the best phone available in market. Display, battery, performance, response time, in screen finger print reader are really worth for the money. But camera needs huge improvement. Compared with mi note 5 pro, 6 pro, poco f1 camera with 6T's camera. All those cameras are outstanding.OnePlus may have to come with some serious fix for their camera. After installing a security patch and update camera became much better, still it was not able to complete with budget phones.

Before I write something about the phone or its specs, I would like to say I keep changing smartphone and usually I buy in range of 10K-15K however, since last 1 year no smartphone was fascinating me apart from POCO F1 but already being a MI user ( 6 MI phones used since last 5 years) and few cousins already owning it,  It didn't allow me to buy same. But, I was more concern with the price and then I started searching a lot about all the latest smartphone who has Snapdragon 845 SOC I ended up my search on One Plus 6T.Today, I'm happy enough to share this review after using the device for 3 months. All I would say if you have a budget of 30K then spend some more and go for One Plus 6T as of now.Now Lets talk about pros and cons:Pros:Great battery life With super fast chargingAmazing performance and smart boost featurePremium design with shining glassImpressive rear and front camera with good quality low light capturingIn display fingerprint scanner is really fast and I Love the cosmos effectNo heating at all, I m a pubg lover too.Cons:No headphone jack but you'll get a converter, I wished they could provide ear plug directly instead of converter.No notification LED lightsNo microSD card slot but Its okay I m not much storage guy 128GB is more than enough for me.The major one for me atleast, PRICE I know its a flagship device but I want this at 30KRating as per the usage of last 3 months so far.Weight: 9/10OS: 9/10Screen quality: 9/10CPU: 10/10Performance: 10/10Storage: 10/10 (113 gb almost)Battery: 9/10Rear camera: 9/10Front camera: 8/10In display fingerprint scanner: 9/10Face unlock: 8/10Thanks. I hope this will help you a bit to decide.

The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.The display is a 6.41-inch AMOLED panel having 19.6:9 aspect ratio. Thanks to its 85.6% screen to body ratio, the phone doesn’t feel large in hand despite the big screen size.There’s no upgrade in the display resolution this time as well. It has a full HD (2340 x 1080p) display with 402ppi pixel density. But in all honesty, the AMOLED display on the OnePlus 6T still offers gorgeous picture quality. The colors pop, it looks immersive and there’s no compromise with the details.The back of the phone is relatively cleaner, as there is only the camera setup since the fingerprint is moved under the display. On the right edge of the phone is a power on button, which is one of your options for waking the device – the other is a double tap on the screen - and above that is the signature OnePlus slider that allows you to mute your phone with a quick flick.OnePlus has done splendid enhancements in their smartphone design over the years. But of all the designs, the OnePlus 6 looked like their most premium work till date and that’s a constant on the OnePlus 6T. The company uses a 3D glass back on the phone which looks great without compromising with the essentials.GOODGreat battery lifeFluid performanceTop-end designImpressive rear cameraBADNo headphone jack'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot

Bought this on Monday and next day for the same price they launched 7. Even though they mentioned only replacement if product damaged, as a frequent buyer they should have provided me the latest model.About the phone, SERIOUSLY! If you are still reading reviews, then stop it right now and just buy it!

my first one plus.and now i know why people go crazy for one plus.one word: snappier !!pros are endless , so not getting into it.cons:fingerprint scanner not as fast as traditional type scanner, hope reader will get a bit better with new updates.No 3.5mm headphone jack. Not easy to adapt with type c audio out. Need to start using Bluetooth headset.No wireless charging. But dash carge is awesome and only time wireless charging will be missed is while using type c port for headphones.

This is one of the best phone, after using iPhone for good 4 years, MI for 2 years it was time to try for something new. This time i decided to go with Oneplus that too 6t, i rate it at 5on 5 there are reasons to it.1. Handy - phone / keypad should always be top priority and its spot on.2. Picture and sound quality - it's far beyond the expectations , i do own DSLR from 10 years and understand the importance of the pictures very well. Shooting instantly , clicking in low lights , depth of pic has been few things which I see image as and OnePlus 6t will never disappoint you.Battery and unlocking power- it lasts for complete day after heavy usage and after the updates the face unlocking has improved dramatically.Thanks OnePlus. I m your customer for Life Time.

Oneplus 6T is a good phone in this price bracket but overall experience of mine with this device after 2 months is not that good as i was expecting because of some basic reasons as follows:1. Pathatic on screen finger scanner. Slow, most of the time not responsive. Just a glittery feature of OnePlus 6T with very poor/slow response.2. Battery life is good but not as good as the picture painted around your head by the Company or OnePlus phones users but yeah! Dash charging is one of the highlight of the phone.3.Service centres and customer support of OnePlus is so pathetic that they just don't care about your concern  and always gives you automated replies even without understanding your concern.At one point you'll feel frustrated with all of this and the backhand customer care team/online support is the real issue for the prospective buyers of the phone or existing users.I hope that no one will face that situation.4. Please do not compare this device with iPhone X or later because apart from dash charging, price, you won't appreciate anything of oneplus 6T.Don't choose OnePlus 6T over iPhone if budget is not the issue.

One of the best investments I have made so far.Let's start with the Pros first:-1) Build Quality:- For 38k the built quality is amazing. You get that premium feel as soon as you hold the phone in your hands.2) Screen Quality:- The screen quality is good. Better than the IPS LCD displays used on Asus Zenfone  5z. Colours are very punchy and the display is very crisp.3) Battery Life:- This is the biggest pro of this device. The 3700mah battery lasts easily for one and a half to 2 days on heavy usage. It can easily last for 3 days on medium usage. The best part is that we have the amazing OnePlus Dash charger. It takes 1hr 28mins to charge from 0 to 100%.4) Oxygen OS:- The Best thing about OnePlus is their fast and fluid UI. It's very close to stock Android which makes the device very snappy. You do not notice any lagg whatsoever.5) In-display Fingerprint:-The USP of OnePlus 6T. Trust me the the fingerprint is very very fast. You can't compare it with that Vivo device which first came with this technology.Now the Cons:-1)No headphone jack:- Not a deal breaker but it might be annoying for people who use wired headphones.2)No Stereo speakers:- The sound output from the speaker is loud enough but considering the price of this device they should have provided stereo speakers.3)No LED Notification Light:- I don't understand why they removed it. You have to rely on the ambient display always.4) Not so good RAM Management:- I think this is a software bug. I have noticed this several times. Apps like YouTube & Instagram does not stay in memory and reloads. This is quite annoying. Hope they fix this with a software update.5) No Wireless Charging:- They call it "Flagship killer" but there's no wireless charging.6)No IP Protection:- It's the 8th "FLAGSHIP KILLER" device from OnePlus but still no IP rating.Final Verdict:-If you already have OnePlus 6 or even the 5T, there's no point of upgrading to 6T. Instead you can wait for next 6 months and get your hands on the OnePlus 7.  The OnePlus 7 will come with Snapdragon 855 which will have support for 5G. Also we will see improvements in the camera and it might even come with Stereo speakers and an IP rating.But if you are currently on an old laggy phone with poor UI, battery life, and looking for a premium device but don't want to spend more than 40k, the OnePlus 6T will prove as a very good upgrade.

The phone is useless. The phone does not switch off if the battery dies down. I had a horrible experience and have been disconnected for more than twelve hours now.Service my AMAZON, that too to PRIME CUSTOMERS in this case has been very disappointing. Knowing fully well that Phones are required for connectivity, the company has fixed a technical visit after two days. This is probably the LAST order i am making with AMAZON and purchasing a phone made by a CHINESE BRAND.

One Plus 6T is an amazing phone for speed and performance and camera quality. It also has a very good battery backup and can easily go upto 1.5 days at least with day long internet browsing and video streaming and music. If you are a hard core gamer like me, you can definitely count on this phone! Great gaming performance without lag or heating issues and can easily support hours of gaming time without charging. I have been using this for about 15-20 days now and am already a big fan of this One Plus device. This is my 2nd One Plus phone and they have proved it again that this really is a flagship killer!

Bought it for 29165/- (Redmi note 5 exchange + 2000 instant discount on ICICI card + 1000 cash back at Amazon pay)  on the day of its launch.It's been 4 days with this phone and the experience is great.Pros:1) The on-screen fingerprint is fast enough2) Excellent display3) Great battery life (Getting 1.5-2 days)4) Superb build quality5) Android Pie out of the box6) 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 6 screen7) 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM on base 6T version.8) Comes with DASH charger which will charge your mobile from 0-100% in 1.5 hrs.9) No sign of heating during heavy usage10) Speaker sound quality is good and loud enough.11) Both Front and the Rear camera takes very good picturesCons:1) No 3.5mm jack ( An extra connecter will be provided in the box to connect 3.5mm jack headphone).2) No wireless charging.3) It has a glass back which means a fingerprint magnet. We should use back case( you will get a good quality back case in the box).4) It has 6.4-inch screen. Not for people with small hands.5) No notification lightThis phone is an excellent value for money. Just go for it, you will never regret.
